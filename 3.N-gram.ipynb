      "on ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though\n",
      "once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and\n",
      "peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to\n",

      "spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.  And at first, this sort of\n",

      "weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?  Do you think\n",
      "the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I\n",

      "that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same\n",
      "way--either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and\n",
      "so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each\n",

      "\n",
      "Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\n",
      "paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single\n",
      "penny that I ever heard of.  On the contrary, passengers themselves\n",
      "must pay.  And there is all the difference in the world between\n",
      "paying and being paid.  The act of paying is perhaps the most\n",
      "uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon\n",
      "us.  But BEING PAID,--what will compare with it?  The urbane activity\n",

      "I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on\n",

      "it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at\n",
      "the space between his legs.  He was trying his hand at a ship under\n",

      "only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for\n",

      "their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen\n",
      "comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with\n",
      "icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.  They had\n",
      "just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they\n",
      "entered.  No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the\n",
      "whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there\n",
      "officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.  One complained\n",
      "of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like\n",
      "potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for\n",
      "all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing,\n",

      "I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\n",
      "he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\n",
      "own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\n",
      "noise as the rest.  This man interested me at once; and since the\n",
      "sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\n",
      "but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned),\n",
      "I will here venture upon a little description of him.  He stood full\n",
      "six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a\n",
      "coffer-dam.  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.  His face was\n",
      "deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the\n",
      "contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some\n",
      "reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.  His voice at\n",
      "once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I\n",
      "thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the\n",
      "Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his companions\n",
      "had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I\n",
      "saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.  In a few\n",
      "minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it\n",
      "seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry\n",
      "of \"Bulkington!  Bulkington! where's Bulkington?\" and darted out of\n",
      "the house in pursuit of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost\n",
      "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate\n",
      "myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to\n",
      "the entrance of the seamen.\n",
      "\n",
      "No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.  In fact, you would a good deal\n",
      "rather not sleep with your own brother.  I don't know how it is, but\n",
      "people like to be private when they are sleeping.  And when it comes\n",
      "to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\n",
      "town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections\n",
      "indefinitely multiply.  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a\n",
      "sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors\n",
      "no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.  To\n",
      "be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your\n",

      "your own skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\n",
      "thought of sleeping with him.  It was fair to presume that being a\n",
      "harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be\n",
      "of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.  I began to twitch all\n",
      "over.  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought\n",
      "to be home and going bedwards.  Suppose now, he should tumble in upon\n",
      "me at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been\n",
      "coming?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord!  I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\n",
      "mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here\"--feeling of the knots\n",
      "and notches.  \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's\n",
      "plane there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough.\"\n",
      "So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief\n",
      "first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,\n",
      "the while grinning like an ape.  The shavings flew right and left;\n",
      "till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.\n",
      "The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for\n",
      "heaven's sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did\n",
      "not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a\n",
      "pine plank.  So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and\n",
      "throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went\n",
      "about his business, and left me in a brown study.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\n",
      "short; but that could be mended with a chair.  But it was a foot too\n",
      "narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\n",
      "than the planed one--so there was no yoking them.  I then placed the\n",
      "first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\n",
      "leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.\n",
      "But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me\n",
      "from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at\n",
      "all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one\n",
      "from the window, and both together formed a series of small\n",
      "whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought\n",
      "to spend the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I\n",
      "steal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,\n",
      "not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?  It seemed no bad\n",
      "idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.  For who could tell\n",
      "but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the\n",
      "harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me\n",
      "down!\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\n",
      "spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I\n",
      "began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable\n",
      "prejudices against this unknown harpooneer.  Thinks I, I'll wait\n",
      "awhile; he must be dropping in before long.  I'll have a good look at\n",
      "him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after\n",
      "all--there's no telling.\n",
      "\n",
      "But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and\n",
      "threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord! said I, \"what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep\n",
      "such late hours?\"  It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\n",
      "mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.  \"No,\" he\n",
      "answered, \"generally he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to\n",
      "rise--yes, he's the bird what catches the worm.  But to-night he\n",
      "went out a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him\n",
      "so late, unless, may be, he can't sell his head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you\n",

      "this town?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's precisely it,\" said the landlord, \"and I told him he couldn't\n",

      "\"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I tell you what it is, landlord,\" said I quite calmly, \"you'd better\n",
      "stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May be not,\" taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, \"but I\n",
      "rayther guess you'll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a\n",
      "slanderin' his head.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "snow-storm--\"landlord, stop whittling.  You and I must understand one\n",
      "another, and that too without delay.  I come to your house and want a\n",
      "bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\n",
      "belongs to a certain harpooneer.  And about this harpooneer, whom I\n",
      "have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\n",
      "exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\n",
      "towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of\n",
      "connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the\n",
      "highest degree.  I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and\n",
      "what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe\n",
      "to spend the night with him.  And in the first place, you will be so\n",
      "good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I\n",
      "take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've\n",
      "no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean,\n",
      "landlord, YOU, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would\n",
      "thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long breath, \"that's a purty\n",
      "long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.  But be easy,\n",
      "be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just\n",
      "arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New\n",
      "Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but\n",
      "one, and that one he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's\n",

      "streets when folks is goin' to churches.  He wanted to, last Sunday,\n",
      "but I stopped him just as he was goin' out of the door with four\n",
      "heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and\n",
      "showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling\n",
      "me--but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who\n",
      "stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged\n",
      "in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed;\n",
      "Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.  There's\n",
      "plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty\n",
      "big bed that.  Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and\n",
      "little Johnny in the foot of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling\n",
      "about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came\n",
      "near breaking his arm.  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.  Come\n",
      "along here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted\n",
      "a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.  But I\n",
      "stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed\n",
      "\"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come\n",
      "to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I\n",
      "was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure\n",
      "enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\n",
      "harpooneers to sleep abreast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea\n",
      "chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there,\n",
      "make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\"  I turned\n",
      "round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.  Though none of\n",
      "the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.  I then\n",
      "glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\n",
      "could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude\n",
      "shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man\n",
      "striking a whale.  Of things not properly belonging to the room,\n",
      "there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one\n",
      "corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's\n",
      "wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a\n",
      "parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the\n",
      "fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close to\n",
      "the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\n",
      "arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.  I can compare\n",
      "it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with\n",
      "little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills\n",
      "round an Indian moccasin.  There was a hole or slit in the middle of\n",
      "this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.  But could\n",
      "it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,\n",
      "and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?\n",
      "I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being\n",
      "uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though\n",
      "this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.  I\n",
      "went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never\n",
      "saw such a sight in my life.  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry\n",
      "that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\n",
      "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.  After thinking some time\n",
      "on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then\n",
      "stood in the middle of the room thinking.  I then took off my coat,\n",
      "and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.  But beginning to feel\n",
      "very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the\n",
      "landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that\n",
      "night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of\n",
      "my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into\n",
      "bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\n",
      "there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\n",
      "sleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\n",
      "pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I\n",
      "heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light\n",
      "come into the room from under the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\n",
      "head-peddler.  But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a\n",
      "word till spoken to.  Holding a light in one hand, and that identical\n",
      "New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and\n",
      "without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off\n",
      "from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at\n",
      "the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the\n",
      "room.  I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted\n",
      "for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.  This\n",
      "accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a\n",
      "sight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here\n",
      "and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.  Yes, it's\n",
      "just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight,\n",
      "got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.  But at\n",
      "that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\n",
      "plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\n",
      "squares on his cheeks.  They were stains of some sort or other.  At\n",
      "first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the\n",
      "truth occurred to me.  I remembered a story of a white man--a\n",
      "whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by\n",
      "them.  I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant\n",
      "voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.  And what is it,\n",
      "thought I, after all!  It's only his outside; a man can be honest in\n",
      "any sort of skin.  But then, what to make of his unearthly\n",
      "complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and\n",
      "completely independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be sure, it\n",
      "might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never\n",
      "heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.\n",
      "However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun\n",
      "there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.  Now, while\n",
      "all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this\n",
      "harpooneer never noticed me at all.  But, after some difficulty\n",
      "having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently\n",
      "pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair\n",
      "on.  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he\n",
      "then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed\n",
      "it down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beaver\n",
      "hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.  There was no\n",
      "hair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small\n",
      "scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald purplish head now\n",
      "looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.  Had not the stranger\n",
      "stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\n",
      "than ever I bolted a dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,\n",
      "but it was the second floor back.  I am no coward, but what to make\n",
      "of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my\n",
      "comprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely\n",
      "nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as\n",
      "much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken\n",
      "into my room at the dead of night.  In fact, I was so afraid of him\n",
      "that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a\n",
      "satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last\n",
      "showed his chest and arms.  As I live, these covered parts of him\n",
      "were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was\n",
      "all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty\n",
      "Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.\n",
      "Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green\n",
      "frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.  It was now quite\n",
      "plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard\n",
      "of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian\n",
      "country.  I quaked to think of it.  A peddler of heads too--perhaps\n",
      "the heads of his own brothers.  He might take a fancy to\n",
      "mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\n",
      "something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\n",
      "that he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or\n",
      "wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he\n",
      "fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little\n",
      "deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a\n",
      "three days' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first\n",
      "I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved\n",
      "in some similar manner.  But seeing that it was not at all limber,\n",
      "and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded\n",
      "that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to\n",
      "be.  For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing\n",
      "the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like\n",
      "a tenpin, between the andirons.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks\n",
      "inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very\n",
      "appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\n",
      "ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.  First he takes\n",
      "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and\n",
      "places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship\n",
      "biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the\n",
      "shavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty\n",
      "snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers\n",
      "(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded\n",
      "in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a\n",
      "little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.  But the\n",
      "little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he\n",
      "never moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied by\n",
      "still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be\n",
      "praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,\n",
      "during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\n",
      "At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very\n",
      "unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\n",
      "carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\n",
      "seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\n",
      "operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\n",
      "now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in\n",
      "which I had so long been bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal\n",
      "one.  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of\n",
      "it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth\n",
      "at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.  The next\n",
      "moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk\n",
      "between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out, I could not\n",
      "help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began\n",
      "feeling me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\n",
      "against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\n",
      "be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.  But\n",
      "his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill\n",
      "comprehended my meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I\n",

      "me in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!\" shouted I.  \"Landlord!\n",
      "Watch!  Coffin!  Angels! save me!\"\n",

      "the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on\n",
      "fire.  But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the\n",
      "room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here\n",
      "wouldn't harm a hair of your head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn't you tell me that\n",
      "that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "sitting up in bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You gettee in,\" he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\n",
      "throwing the clothes to one side.  He really did this in not only a\n",
      "civil but a really kind and charitable way.  I stood looking at him a\n",
      "moment.  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\n",
      "looking cannibal.  What's all this fuss I have been making about,\n",
      "thought I to myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has\n",
      "just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.\n",
      "Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,\n",

      "will turn in with him.  But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed\n",
      "with me.  It's dangerous.  Besides, I ain't insured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\n",

      "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm\n",
      "thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.  You had\n",
      "almost thought I had been his wife.  The counterpane was of\n",
      "patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;\n",
      "and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan\n",
      "labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise\n",
      "shade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically\n",
      "in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various\n",
      "times--this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a\n",
      "strip of that same patchwork quilt.  Indeed, partly lying on it as\n",
      "the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the\n",
      "quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the\n",
      "sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was\n",
      "hugging me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was\n",
      "a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell\n",
      "me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely\n",
      "settle.  The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper\n",
      "or other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had\n",
      "seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,\n",
      "somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\n",
      "supperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and\n",
      "packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon\n",
      "of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I\n",
      "felt dreadfully.  But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went\n",
      "to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as\n",
      "possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the\n",
      "sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must\n",
      "elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.  Sixteen hours in bed!\n",
      "the small of my back ached to think of it.  And it was so light too;\n",
      "the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in\n",
      "the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.  I felt\n",
      "worse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in\n",
      "my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw\n",
      "myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a\n",
      "good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning\n",
      "me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  But she was the\n",
      "best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to\n",
      "my room.  For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great\n",
      "deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest\n",
      "subsequent misfortunes.  At last I must have fallen into a troubled\n",
      "nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in\n",
      "dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped\n",
      "in outer darkness.  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my\n",
      "frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\n",
      "supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung over the\n",
      "counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,\n",
      "to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.\n",
      "For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most\n",
      "awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that\n",
      "if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\n",
      "broken.  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from\n",
      "me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and\n",
      "for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\n",
      "attempts to explain the mystery.  Nay, to this very hour, I often\n",
      "puzzle myself with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\n",
      "supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness,\n",
      "to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan\n",
      "arm thrown round me.  But at length all the past night's events\n",
      "soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only\n",
      "alive to the comical predicament.  For though I tried to move his\n",
      "arm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still\n",
      "hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.\n",
      "I now strove to rouse him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a\n",
      "snore.  I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a\n",
      "horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.  Throwing aside the\n",
      "counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as\n",
      "if it were a hatchet-faced baby.  A pretty pickle, truly, thought I;\n",
      "abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a\n",
      "tomahawk!  \"Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\"  At\n",
      "length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant\n",
      "expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male\n",
      "in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;\n",
      "and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a\n",
      "Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a\n",
      "pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not\n",
      "altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\n",
      "consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning\n",
      "over him.  Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious\n",
      "misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a\n",
      "creature.  When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the\n",
      "character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to\n",
      "the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and\n",
      "sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress\n",
      "first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole\n",
      "apartment to myself.  Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances,\n",
      "this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages\n",
      "have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous\n",
      "how essentially polite they are.  I pay this particular compliment to\n",
      "Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and\n",
      "consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him\n",
      "from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my\n",
      "curiosity getting the better of my breeding.  Nevertheless, a man\n",
      "like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well\n",
      "worth unusual regarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\n",
      "one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his\n",
      "boots.  What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\n",
      "next movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under\n",
      "the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I\n",
      "inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of\n",
      "propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private\n",
      "when putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature\n",
      "in the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.  He was\n",
      "just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest\n",
      "possible manners.  His education was not yet completed.  He was an\n",
      "undergraduate.  If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very\n",
      "probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,\n",
      "if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of\n",
      "getting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged with his\n",
      "hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began\n",
      "creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed\n",
      "to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--probably not made\n",
      "to order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off\n",
      "of a bitter cold morning.\n",

      "Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\n",

      "into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\n",
      "Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots\n",
      "on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet\n",
      "somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as\n",
      "possible.  He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.  At that\n",
      "time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but\n",
      "Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his\n",
      "ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.  He then donned his\n",
      "waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand\n",
      "centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.\n",
      "I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he\n",
      "takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden\n",
      "stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and\n",
      "striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous\n",
      "scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.  Thinks I, Queequeg,\n",
      "this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.  Afterwards I\n",
      "wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine\n",

      "I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable\n",

      "upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the\n",

      "sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had\n",
      "dedicated his life to the ministry.  At the time I now write of,\n",
      "Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort\n",
      "of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for\n",
      "among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild\n",
      "gleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth\n",
      "even beneath February's snow.  No one having previously heard his\n",
      "history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the\n",
      "utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical\n",
      "peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life\n",
      "he had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,\n",
      "and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran\n",
      "down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed\n",
      "almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had\n",
      "absorbed.  However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one\n",
      "removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,\n",
      "arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\n",
      "regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\n",
      "floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\n",
      "architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\n",
      "finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular\n",
      "side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.\n",
      "The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome\n",
      "pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself\n",
      "nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole\n",
      "contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no\n",
      "means in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the\n",
      "ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the\n",
      "man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly\n",
      "sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted\n",
      "the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\n",
      "with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were\n",
      "of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.  At my first\n",
      "glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient\n",
      "for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.\n",
      "For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,\n",
      "slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up\n",
      "the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving\n",
      "him impregnable in his little Quebec.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\n",
      "Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\n",
      "sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\n",
      "mere tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober\n",
      "reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something\n",
      "unseen.  Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he\n",
      "signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward\n",
      "worldly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished with the meat and\n",
      "wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is\n",
      "a self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a\n",
      "perennial well of water within the walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\n",
      "borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings.  Between the marble\n",
      "cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its\n",
      "back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship\n",
      "beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and\n",
      "snowy breakers.  But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling\n",
      "clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed\n",
      "forth an angel's face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of\n",
      "radiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver\n",
      "plate now inserted into the Victory's plank where Nelson fell.  \"Ah,\n",
      "noble ship,\" the angel seemed to say, \"beat on, beat on, thou noble\n",
      "ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the\n",
      "clouds are rolling off--serenest azure is at hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\n",
      "had achieved the ladder and the picture.  Its panelled front was in\n",
      "the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\n",
      "projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's\n",
      "fiddle-headed beak.\n",
      "\n",

      "In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely,\n",
      "and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at\n",
      "all frontiers.  So Jonah's Captain prepares to test the length of\n",
      "Jonah's purse, ere he judge him openly.  He charges him thrice the\n",
      "usual sum; and it's assented to.  Then the Captain knows that Jonah\n",

      "paves its rear with gold.  Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse,\n",
      "prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.  He rings every coin to\n",
      "find a counterfeit.  Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is\n",
      "put down for his passage.  'Point out my state-room, Sir,' says Jonah\n",

      "there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something\n",
      "about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed to be locked\n",
      "within.  All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into\n",
      "his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on\n",

      "with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight\n",

      "harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost\n",
      "miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the\n",
      "air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow\n",
      "landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his\n",

      "side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck.\n",

      "overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the\n",

      "back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant\n",
      "seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.  Nothing was done,\n",
      "and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed\n",
      "towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower\n",
      "jaw of an exasperated whale.  In the midst of this consternation,\n",
      "Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of\n",
      "the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks,\n",
      "and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as\n",
      "it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way\n",
      "trapped, and all was safe.  The schooner was run into the wind, and\n",
      "while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped\n",
      "to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.\n",
      "For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing\n",
      "his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his\n",
      "brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.  I looked at the grand\n",
      "and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.  The greenhorn had\n",
      "gone down.  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water,\n",
      "Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see\n",
      "just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.  A few minutes\n",
      "more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the\n",
      "other dragging a lifeless form.  The boat soon picked them up.  The\n",
      "poor bumpkin was restored.  All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump;\n",
      "the captain begged his pardon.  From that hour I clove to Queequeg\n",

      "off; that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning\n",

      "been diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little\n",
      "god--and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly\n",
      "insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among\n",
      "the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;\n",
      "instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of\n",
      "the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed\n",
      "befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a\n",
      "vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light\n",
      "upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in\n",
      "that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present\n",
      "irrespective of Queequeg.\n",

      "I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed\n",
      "great confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising\n",
      "forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a\n",
      "rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the\n",

      "\n",

      "settle that trifling little affair.  Next morning early, leaving\n",
      "Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom--for it seemed that\n",
      "it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation,\n",

      "galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\n",
      "rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod.  She was a ship of the\n",
      "old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned\n",
      "claw-footed look about her.  Long seasoned and weather-stained in the\n",
      "typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was\n",
      "darkened like a French grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and\n",
      "Siberia.  Her venerable bows looked bearded.  Her masts--cut\n",
      "somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost\n",
      "overboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of\n",
      "the three old kings of Cologne.  Her ancient decks were worn and\n",
      "wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury\n",
      "Cathedral where Becket bled.  But to all these her old antiquities,\n",
      "were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild\n",
      "business that for more than half a century she had followed.  Old\n",
      "Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another\n",
      "vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal\n",
      "owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his\n",
      "chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid\n",
      "it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\n",
      "unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or\n",
      "bedstead.  She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor,\n",
      "his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.  She was a thing of\n",
      "trophies.  A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the\n",
      "chased bones of her enemies.  All round, her unpanelled, open\n",
      "bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp\n",
      "teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old\n",
      "hempen thews and tendons to.  Those thews ran not through base blocks\n",
      "of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory.\n",
      "Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a\n",
      "tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the\n",
      "long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.  The helmsman who\n",
      "steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he\n",

      "of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast.  It\n",
      "seemed only a temporary erection used in port.  It was of a conical\n",
      "shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of\n",
      "limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws\n",
      "of the right-whale.  Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a\n",
      "circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each\n",
      "other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose\n",
      "hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old\n",

      "by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and\n",
      "the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden\n",
      "of command.  He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling\n",
      "all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of\n",

      "style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the\n",
      "minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen\n",
      "from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\n",

      "Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\n",
      "ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\n",
      "pointing towards the open ocean.  The prospect was unlimited, but\n",
      "exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that\n",
      "I could see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what's the report?\" said Peleg when I came back; \"what did ye\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Not much,\" I replied--\"nothing but water; considerable horizon\n",
      "though, and there's a squall coming up, I think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world?  Do ye wish to\n",

      "where you stand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and\n",
      "the Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all\n",
      "this I now repeated to Peleg.  Seeing me so determined, he expressed\n",
      "his willingness to ship me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\" he added--\"come\n",
      "along with ye.\"  And so saying, he led the way below deck into the\n",
      "cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\n",
      "surprising figure.  It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along\n",
      "with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the\n",
      "other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by\n",
      "a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery\n",
      "wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of\n",
      "plank, or a nail or two in the ship.  People in Nantucket invest\n",
      "their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in\n",
      "approved state stocks bringing in good interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\n",
      "Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and\n",
      "to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure\n",
      "the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously\n",
      "modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.  For some of\n",
      "these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and\n",
      "whale-hunters.  They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a\n",
      "vengeance.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\n",
      "Scripture names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in\n",
      "childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of\n",
      "the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\n",
      "adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\n",
      "unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\n",
      "unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.  And\n",
      "when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,\n",
      "with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the\n",
      "stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest\n",
      "waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been\n",
      "led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all\n",
      "nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin\n",
      "voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some\n",
      "help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty\n",
      "language--that man makes one in a whole nation's census--a mighty\n",
      "pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.  Nor will it at all\n",
      "detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other\n",
      "circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness\n",
      "at the bottom of his nature.  For all men tragically great are made\n",
      "so through a certain morbidness.  Be sure of this, O young ambition,\n",
      "all mortal greatness is but disease.  But, as yet we have not to do\n",
      "with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if\n",
      "indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the\n",
      "Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired\n",
      "whaleman.  But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what\n",
      "are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious\n",
      "things the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been\n",
      "originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket\n",
      "Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many\n",
      "unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn--all that had not\n",
      "moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as\n",
      "altered one angle of his vest.  Still, for all this immutableness,\n",
      "was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain\n",
      "Peleg.  Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms\n",
      "against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the\n",
      "Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet\n",
      "had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of\n",
      "leviathan gore.  How now in the contemplative evening of his days,\n",
      "the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do\n",
      "not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably\n",
      "he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a\n",
      "man's religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.\n",
      "This world pays dividends.  Rising from a little cabin-boy in short\n",
      "clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied\n",
      "waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,\n",
      "and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded\n",
      "his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the\n",
      "goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet\n",
      "receiving of his well-earned income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\n",

      "task-master.  They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\n",
      "curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his\n",
      "crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the\n",
      "hospital, sore exhausted and worn out.  For a pious man, especially\n",

      "somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work\n",
      "out of them.  When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured\n",
      "eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till\n",
      "you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to\n",
      "work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.  Indolence and\n",
      "idleness perished before him.  His own person was the exact\n",
      "embodiment of his utilitarian character.  On his long, gaunt body, he\n",
      "carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,\n",
      "economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\n",
      "followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.  The space between the\n",
      "decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always\n",
      "sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.  His\n",
      "broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his\n",
      "drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he\n",
      "seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bildad,\" cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh?  Ye have\n",
      "been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\n",
      "certain knowledge.  How far ye got, Bildad?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\n",
      "Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\n",
      "and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says he's our man, Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He'll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\n",
      "his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as\n",
      "Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.  But I\n",
      "said nothing, only looking round me sharply.  Peleg now threw open a\n",
      "chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink\n",
      "before him, and seated himself at a little table.  I began to think\n",
      "it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be\n",
      "willing to engage for the voyage.  I was already aware that in the\n",
      "whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the\n",
      "captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that\n",
      "these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining\n",
      "to the respective duties of the ship's company.  I was also aware\n",
      "that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very\n",
      "large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a\n",
      "ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I\n",
      "had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the\n",
      "275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that\n",
      "might eventually amount to.  And though the 275th lay was what they\n",
      "call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had\n",
      "a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear\n",
      "out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which\n",
      "I would not have to pay one stiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\n",
      "fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed.  But I am one of\n",
      "those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite\n",
      "content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am\n",
      "putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud.  Upon the whole, I\n",
      "thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not\n",
      "have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was\n",
      "of a broad-shouldered make.\n",
      "\n",
      "But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\n",
      "receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had\n",
      "heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony\n",
      "Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,\n",
      "therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,\n",
      "left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two.\n",
      "And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty\n",
      "deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on\n",
      "board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his\n",
      "Bible as if at his own fireside.  Now while Peleg was vainly trying\n",
      "to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small\n",
      "surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these\n",
      "proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself\n",
      "out of his book, \"LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,\n",
      "where moth--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted Peleg, \"what d'ye say, what lay\n",
      "shall we give this young man?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust\n",
      "do corrupt, but LAY--'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seventh!  Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for\n",
      "one, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do\n",
      "corrupt.  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though\n",
      "from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a\n",
      "landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you\n",
      "come to make a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less\n",
      "than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought\n",
      "at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried Peleg, \"thou dost not want to\n",
      "swindle this young man! he must have more than that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without\n",
      "lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling--\"for where your treasure\n",
      "is, there will your heart be also.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do\n",
      "ye hear that, Bildad!  The three hundredth lay, I say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider\n",
      "the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and\n",
      "orphans, many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the\n",
      "labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those\n",
      "widows and those orphans.  The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay,\n",
      "Captain Peleg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou Bildad!\" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\n",
      "cabin.  \"Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in\n",
      "these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that\n",
      "would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed\n",
      "round Cape Horn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be drawing\n",
      "ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art\n",
      "still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\n",
      "conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee\n",
      "foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing,\n",
      "ye insult me.  It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature\n",
      "that he's bound to hell.  Flukes and flames!  Bildad, say that again\n",
      "to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a\n",
      "live goat with all his hair and horns on.  Out of the cabin, ye\n",
      "canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\n",
      "marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\n",
      "responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up\n",
      "all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\n",
      "commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,\n",
      "who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the\n",
      "awakened wrath of Peleg.  But to my astonishment, he sat down again\n",
      "on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest\n",
      "intention of withdrawing.  He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg\n",
      "and his ways.  As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had,\n",
      "there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb,\n",
      "though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.  \"Whew!\"\n",
      "he whistled at last--\"the squall's gone off to leeward, I think.\n",
      "Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen,\n",
      "will ye.  My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.  That's he; thank\n",
      "ye, Bildad.  Now then, my young man, Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye\n",
      "say?  Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth\n",
      "lay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship\n",
      "too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" said Peleg.  \"Fetch him along, and we'll look at him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book\n",
      "in which he had again been burying himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\" said Peleg.  \"Has he ever\n",
      "whaled it any?\" turning to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, bring him along then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that\n",
      "I had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the\n",
      "identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round\n",
      "the Cape.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\n",
      "Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\n",
      "indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out,\n",
      "and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself\n",
      "visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are\n",
      "so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,\n",
      "that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of\n",
      "that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,\n",
      "but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.  However, it\n",
      "is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing\n",
      "yourself into his hands.  Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg,\n",
      "inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?  It's all right enough;\n",
      "thou art shipped.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but I should like to see him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present.  I don't know\n",
      "exactly what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\n",
      "house; a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so.  In fact, he ain't\n",
      "sick; but no, he isn't well either.  Any how, young man, he won't\n",
      "always see me, so I don't suppose he will thee.  He's a queer man,\n",
      "Captain Ahab--so some think--but a good one.  Oh, thou'lt like him\n",
      "well enough; no fear, no fear.  He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man,\n",
      "Captain Ahab; doesn't speak much; but, when he does speak, then you\n",
      "may well listen.  Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's above the common;\n",
      "Ahab's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the cannibals; been used to\n",
      "deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier,\n",
      "stranger foes than whales.  His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest\n",
      "that out of all our isle!  Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he\n",
      "ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,\n",
      "was a crowned king!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And a very vile one.  When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did\n",
      "they not lick his blood?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come hither to me--hither, hither,\" said Peleg, with a significance\n",
      "in his eye that almost startled me.  \"Look ye, lad; never say that on\n",
      "board the Pequod.  Never say it anywhere.  Captain Ahab did not name\n",
      "himself.  'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed\n",
      "mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old.  And yet the old\n",
      "squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove\n",
      "prophetic.  And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the\n",
      "same.  I wish to warn thee.  It's a lie.  I know Captain Ahab well;\n",
      "I've sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is--a good\n",
      "man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good\n",
      "man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of him.  Aye,\n",
      "aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the\n",
      "passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was\n",
      "the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that\n",
      "about, as any one might see.  I know, too, that ever since he lost\n",
      "his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of\n",
      "moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass\n",
      "off.  And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man,\n",
      "it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\n",
      "one.  So good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he\n",
      "happens to have a wicked name.  Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not\n",
      "three voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.  Think of that; by that\n",
      "sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any\n",

      "As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been\n",
      "incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain\n",
      "wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him.  And somehow, at the\n",
      "time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know\n",
      "what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg.  And yet I also felt a\n",
      "strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all\n",

      "him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but\n",
      "his ordinary round jacket on.  For some time, do all I would, I could\n",
      "not get into the faintest doze.  I had blown out the candle; and the\n",
      "mere thought of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that\n",
      "uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me\n",
      "really wretched.  Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room\n",

      "But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break\n",
      "of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as\n",
      "if he had been screwed down to the floor.  But as soon as the first\n",
      "glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating\n",
      "joints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay;\n",

      "the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to\n",
      "the various religions of the present time, during which time I\n",
      "labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and\n",
      "prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark\n",
      "nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in\n",
      "short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense.  I told him,\n",
      "too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and\n",
      "sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now\n",
      "so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.  Besides,\n",
      "argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in;\n",
      "and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.\n",
      "This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such\n",

      "undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the\n",
      "hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\n",
      "\n",

      "dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\n",
      "in.  He said no; only upon one memorable occasion.  It was after a\n",
      "great feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great\n",
      "battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two\n",
      "o'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I knew\n",
      "the inferences without his further hinting them.  I had seen a sailor\n",
      "who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the\n",
      "custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all\n",
      "the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,\n",
      "they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like\n",
      "a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in\n",
      "their mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all\n",
      "his friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas\n",
      "turkeys.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\n",
      "impression upon Queequeg.  Because, in the first place, he somehow\n",
      "seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\n",
      "from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\n",
      "than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\n",
      "finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\n",
      "religion than I did.  He looked at me with a sort of condescending\n",
      "concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that\n",
      "such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical\n",
      "pagan piety.\n",

      "questioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand\n",
      "that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all\n",
      "sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the\n",
      "custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to\n",
      "furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up\n",
      "eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and\n",
      "alcoves.  Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much\n",
      "better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into\n",
      "walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and\n",
      "desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree,\n",
      "perhaps in some damp marshy place.\n",
      "\n",
      "While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the\n",

      "The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and\n",
      "a Quaker by descent.  He was a long, earnest man, and though born on\n",
      "an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh\n",
      "being hard as twice-baked biscuit.  Transported to the Indies, his\n",
      "live blood would not spoil like bottled ale.  He must have been born\n",
      "in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast\n",
      "days for which his state is famous.  Only some thirty arid summers\n",
      "had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical\n",
      "superfluousness.  But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more\n",
      "the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the\n",
      "indication of any bodily blight.  It was merely the condensation of\n",
      "the man.  He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary.  His\n",
      "pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it,\n",
      "and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified\n",
      "Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to\n",
      "come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid\n",
      "sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted\n",
      "to do well in all climates.  Looking into his eyes, you seemed to\n",
      "see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he\n",
      "had calmly confronted through life.  A staid, steadfast man, whose\n",
      "life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a\n",
      "tame chapter of sounds.  Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and\n",
      "fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times\n",
      "affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the\n",
      "rest.  Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep\n",
      "natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did\n",
      "therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of\n",
      "superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring,\n",
      "somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance.  Outward portents and\n",
      "inward presentiments were his.  And if at times these things bent the\n",
      "welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories\n",
      "of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from\n",
      "the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to\n",
      "those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain\n",
      "the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more\n",
      "perilous vicissitudes of the fishery.  \"I will have no man in my\n",
      "boat,\" said Starbuck, \"who is not afraid of a whale.\"  By this, he\n",
      "seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage\n",
      "was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered\n",
      "peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous\n",
      "comrade than a coward.\n",
      "\n",

      "in this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple\n",
      "outfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be\n",
      "foolishly wasted.  Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales\n",
      "after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much\n",
      "persisted in fighting him.  For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this\n",
      "critical ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by\n",
      "them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck\n",
      "well knew.  What doom was his own father's?  Where, in the bottomless\n",
      "deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?\n",
      "\n",
      "With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\n",
      "superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck\n",
      "which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been\n",
      "extreme.  But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so\n",
      "organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he\n",
      "had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently\n",
      "engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,\n",
      "would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up.\n",
      "And brave as he might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly,\n",
      "visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally abiding firm in\n",
      "the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary\n",
      "irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more\n",
      "terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you\n",

      "short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face.\n",
      "You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk\n",
      "without his nose as without his pipe.  He kept a whole row of pipes\n",
      "there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand;\n",
      "and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession,\n",
      "lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then loading\n",
      "them again to be in readiness anew.  For, when Stubb dressed, instead\n",

      "I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of\n",

      "the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead\n",
      "to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from\n",
      "encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was\n",
      "but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring\n",
      "only a little circumvention and some small application of time and\n",
      "trouble in order to kill and boil.  This ignorant, unconscious\n",
      "fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of\n",
      "whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years'\n",
      "voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length\n",
      "of time.  As a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought nails and\n",
      "cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided.  Little Flask was one\n",
      "of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long.  They called\n",

      "And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a\n",

      "harpooneer, who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh\n",
      "lance, when the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the\n",
      "assault; and moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a\n",
      "close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in\n",

      "remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the\n",
      "neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring\n",
      "harpooneers.  In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of\n",
      "Gay-Headers.  Tashtego's long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek\n",
      "bones, and black rounding eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their\n",
      "largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering expression--all this\n",
      "sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of\n",
      "those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England\n",
      "moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main.\n",
      "But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the\n",
      "woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the\n",
      "sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible\n",
      "arrow of the sires.  To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky\n",
      "limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of\n",
      "the earlier Puritans, and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son\n",

      "\n",
      "Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\n",
      "negro-savage, with a lion-like tread--an Ahasuerus to behold.\n",
      "Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the\n",
      "sailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the\n",
      "top-sail halyards to them.  In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily\n",
      "shipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native\n",
      "coast.  And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa,\n",
      "Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen; and\n",
      "having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the\n",
      "ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they\n",
      "shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a\n",
      "giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in\n",
      "his socks.  There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and\n",
      "a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce\n",
      "of a fortress.  Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus\n",

      "there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\n",
      "plank.  His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\n",
      "holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\n",
      "beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow.  There was an infinity of\n",
      "firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the\n",
      "fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.  Not a word he\n",
      "spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their\n",
      "minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if\n",
      "not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.  And\n",
      "not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a\n",
      "crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing\n",
      "dignity of some mighty woe.\n",

      "Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his\n",

      "had; or heavily walking the deck.  As the sky grew less gloomy;\n",
      "indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less\n",
      "a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the\n",
      "dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.  And,\n",
      "by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the\n",

      "last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.  But\n",

      "Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\n",

      "barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send\n",

      "with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will\n",
      "try.  There are some preliminaries to settle.\n",
      "\n",
      "First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\n",
      "is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters\n",
      "it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.  In his\n",
      "System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate\n",
      "the whales from the fish.\"  But of my own knowledge, I know that down\n",
      "to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against\n",
      "Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession of\n",
      "the same seas with the Leviathan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales\n",
      "from the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm\n",
      "bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow\n",
      "ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and finally, \"ex\n",
      "lege naturae jure meritoque.\"  I submitted all this to my friends\n",
      "Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine\n",
      "in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons\n",
      "set forth were altogether insufficient.  Charley profanely hinted\n",
      "they were humbug.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\n",
      "ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\n",
      "This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\n",
      "respect does the whale differ from other fish.  Above, Linnaeus has\n",
      "given you those items.  But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm\n",
      "blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\n",
      "conspicuously to label him for all time to come?  To be short, then,\n",
      "a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.  There you have\n",
      "him.  However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\n",
      "meditation.  A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not\n",
      "a fish, because he is amphibious.  But the last term of the\n",
      "definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.  Almost\n",
      "any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have\n",
      "not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.  Whereas, among\n",
      "spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably\n",
      "assumes a horizontal position.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\n",
      "from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\n",
      "with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\n",
      "hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as\n",
      "alien.*  Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish\n",
      "must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.  Now, then, come\n",
      "the grand divisions of the entire whale host.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins\n",
      "and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are\n",
      "included by many naturalists among the whales.  But as these pig-fish\n",
      "are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of\n",
      "rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout,\n",

      "intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles.  His grand\n",

      "\n",
      "Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a\n",
      "place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board,\n",
      "arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a\n",
      "class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced\n",
      "by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\n",
      "and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in\n",
      "the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\n",
      "officer called the Specksynder.  Literally this word means\n",
      "Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief\n",
      "Harpooneer.  In those days, the captain's authority was restricted to\n",
      "the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the\n",
      "whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or\n",
      "Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.  In the British Greenland Fishery,\n",
      "under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is\n",
      "still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged.  At present\n",
      "he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the\n",
      "captain's more inferior subalterns.  Nevertheless, as upon the good\n",
      "conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely\n",
      "depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an\n",
      "important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night\n",
      "watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck is also\n",
      "his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he\n",
      "should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in\n",
      "some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always,\n",
      "by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\n",
      "this--the first lives aft, the last forward.  Hence, in whale-ships\n",
      "and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the\n",
      "captain; and so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers\n",
      "are lodged in the after part of the ship.  That is to say, they take\n",
      "their meals in the captain's cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly\n",

      "intrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do in some cases\n",
      "tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen\n",
      "generally; yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family\n",
      "these whalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together; for\n",
      "all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck\n",
      "are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.  Indeed,\n",
      "many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper\n",
      "parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in\n",
      "any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if\n",
      "he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.\n",
      "\n",
      "And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least\n",
      "given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only\n",
      "homage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though\n",
      "he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping\n",
      "upon the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to\n",
      "peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be\n",
      "detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of\n",
      "condescension or IN TERROREM, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was\n",
      "by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind\n",

      "of his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained\n",

      "\n",
      "It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale\n",
      "loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his\n",
      "lord and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been\n",
      "taking an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the\n",
      "latitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that\n",
      "daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg.  From his complete\n",
      "inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not\n",
      "heard his menial.  But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds,\n",
      "he swings himself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice,\n",
      "saying, \"Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,\" disappears into the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck,\n",
      "the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then\n",
      "Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the\n",
      "planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some\n",
      "touch of pleasantness, \"Dinner, Mr. Stubb,\" and descends the scuttle.\n",
      "The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly\n",
      "shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with\n",
      "that important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a\n",
      "rapid \"Dinner, Mr. Flask,\" follows after his predecessors.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\n",
      "seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all\n",
      "sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off\n",
      "his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe\n",
      "right over the Grand Turk's head; and then, by a dexterous sleight,\n",
      "pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down\n",
      "rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck,\n",
      "reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music.\n",
      "But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new\n",
      "face altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little Flask\n",
      "enters King Ahab's presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the\n",
      "Slave.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\n",
      "artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck\n",
      "some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and\n",
      "defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those\n",
      "very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in\n",
      "that same commander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not\n",
      "to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head\n",
      "of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical.  Wherefore\n",
      "this difference?  A problem?  Perhaps not.  To have been Belshazzar,\n",
      "King of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but\n",
      "courteously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane\n",
      "grandeur.  But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit\n",
      "presides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests, that\n",
      "man's unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the\n",
      "time; that man's royalty of state transcends Belshazzar's, for\n",
      "Belshazzar was not the greatest.  Who has but once dined his friends,\n",
      "has tasted what it is to be Caesar.  It is a witchery of social\n",
      "czarship which there is no withstanding.  Now, if to this\n",
      "consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master,\n",
      "then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of\n",
      "sea-life just mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned\n",
      "sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but\n",
      "still deferential cubs.  In his own proper turn, each officer waited\n",
      "to be served.  They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in\n",
      "Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.  With\n",
      "one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife, as\n",
      "he carved the chief dish before him.  I do not suppose that for the\n",
      "world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest\n",
      "observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather.  No!  And\n",
      "when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef\n",
      "was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the\n",
      "mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;\n",
      "and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the\n",
      "plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without\n",
      "circumspection.  For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where\n",
      "the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial\n",
      "Electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in\n",
      "awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation;\n",
      "only he himself was dumb.  What a relief it was to choking Stubb,\n",
      "when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below.  And poor little\n",
      "Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family\n",
      "party.  His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have\n",
      "been the drumsticks.  For Flask to have presumed to help himself,\n",
      "this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first\n",
      "degree.  Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more\n",
      "would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\n",
      "nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.  And had Flask\n",
      "helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed\n",
      "it.  Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.\n",
      "Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on\n",
      "account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he\n",
      "deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter\n",
      "was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however\n",
      "it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing.  Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and\n",
      "Flask is the first man up.  Consider!  For hereby Flask's dinner was\n",
      "badly jammed in point of time.  Starbuck and Stubb both had the start\n",
      "of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear.\n",
      "If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have\n",
      "but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his\n",
      "repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than\n",
      "three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to\n",
      "precede Flask to the deck.  Therefore it was that Flask once admitted\n",
      "in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an\n",
      "officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be\n",
      "otherwise than hungry, more or less.  For what he ate did not so much\n",
      "relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.  Peace and\n",
      "satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach.\n",
      "I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned\n",
      "beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast.\n",
      "There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:\n",
      "there's the insanity of life!  Besides, if it were so that any mere\n",
      "sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's official\n",
      "capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\n",
      "vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\n",
      "through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before\n",
      "awful Ahab.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first\n",
      "table in the Pequod's cabin.  After their departure, taking place in\n",
      "inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or\n",
      "rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward.  And\n",
      "then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its\n",
      "residuary legatees.  They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of\n",
      "the high and mighty cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\n",
      "invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire\n",
      "care-free license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those\n",
      "inferior fellows the harpooneers.  While their masters, the mates,\n",
      "seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the\n",
      "harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a\n",
      "report to it.  They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like\n",
      "Indian ships all day loading with spices.  Such portentous appetites\n",
      "had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the\n",
      "previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a\n",
      "great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.\n",
      "And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble\n",
      "hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of\n",
      "accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise.  And\n",
      "once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory\n",
      "by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty\n",
      "wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the\n",
      "circle preliminary to scalping him.  He was naturally a very nervous,\n",
      "shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the\n",
      "progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse.  And what with the\n",
      "standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical\n",
      "tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life\n",
      "was one continual lip-quiver.  Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers\n",
      "furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their\n",
      "clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at\n",
      "them through the blinds of its door, till all was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\n",
      "his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on\n",
      "the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to\n",
      "the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the\n",
      "low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes\n",
      "passenger in a ship.  But for all this, the great negro was\n",
      "wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty.  It seemed hardly possible\n",
      "that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the\n",
      "vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.\n",
      "But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the\n",
      "abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in\n",
      "the sublime life of the worlds.  Not by beef or by bread, are giants\n",
      "made or nourished.  But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of\n",
      "the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the\n",
      "trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth\n",
      "lurked in his own lean arms.  And when he would hear Tashtego singing\n",
      "out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the\n",
      "simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round\n",
      "him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy.  Nor did the\n",
      "whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their\n",
      "lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they\n",
      "would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not\n",
      "at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy.  How could he forget that\n",
      "in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been\n",
      "guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.  Alas!  Dough-Boy!\n",
      "hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.  Not a napkin\n",
      "should he carry on his arm, but a buckler.  In good time, though, to\n",
      "his great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart;\n",
      "to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones\n",
      "jingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\n",
      "there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\n",
      "scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before\n",
      "sleeping-time, when they passed through it to their own peculiar\n",
      "quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale\n",
      "captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights\n",
      "the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone\n",
      "that anybody else is, at any time, permitted there.  So that, in real\n",
      "truth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be\n",
      "said to have lived out of the cabin than in it.  For when they did\n",
      "enter it, it was something as a street-door enters a house; turning\n",
      "inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a\n",
      "permanent thing, residing in the open air.  Nor did they lose much\n",
      "hereby; in the cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was\n",
      "inaccessible.  Though nominally included in the census of\n",
      "Christendom, he was still an alien to it.  He lived in the world, as\n",
      "the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri.  And as when\n",
      "Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying\n",
      "himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking\n",
      "his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab's soul,\n",
      "shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen\n",

      "It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with\n",
      "the other seamen my first mast-head came round.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\n",
      "simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she\n",
      "may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her\n",
      "proper cruising ground.  And if, after a three, four, or five years'\n",
      "voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an\n",
      "empty vial even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last;\n",

      "does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a\n",
      "very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\n",
      "here.  I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the\n",
      "old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to\n",
      "them.  For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must\n",
      "doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest\n",
      "mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was\n",
      "put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have\n",
      "gone by the board, in the dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we\n",
      "cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians.  And\n",
      "that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an\n",
      "assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that\n",
      "the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory\n",
      "singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four\n",
      "sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of\n",
      "their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and\n",
      "sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing\n",
      "out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight.  In Saint Stylites,\n",
      "the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone\n",
      "pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life\n",
      "on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in\n",
      "him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\n",
      "stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by\n",
      "fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything\n",
      "out to the last, literally died at his post.  Of modern\n",
      "standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\n",
      "and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\n",
      "are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\n",
      "discovering any strange sight.  There is Napoleon; who, upon the top\n",
      "of the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred\n",
      "and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\n",
      "whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.  Great\n",
      "Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\n",
      "Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column marks that\n",
      "point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go.  Admiral\n",
      "Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\n",
      "Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\n",
      "token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\n",
      "smoke, must be fire.  But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\n",
      "Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked\n",
      "to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they\n",
      "gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate\n",
      "through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what\n",
      "rocks must be shunned.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\n",
      "standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is\n",
      "not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\n",
      "historian of Nantucket, stands accountable.  The worthy Obed tells\n",
      "us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were\n",
      "regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island\n",
      "erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs\n",
      "ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in\n",
      "a hen-house.  A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay\n",
      "whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to\n",
      "the ready-manned boats nigh the beach.  But this custom has now\n",
      "become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a\n",
      "whale-ship at sea.  The three mast-heads are kept manned from\n",
      "sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the\n",
      "helm), and relieving each other every two hours.  In the serene\n",
      "weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay,\n",
      "to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.  There you stand, a\n",
      "hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if\n",
      "the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your\n",
      "legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships\n",
      "once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.\n",
      "There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing\n",
      "ruffled but the waves.  The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy\n",
      "trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor.  For the most\n",
      "part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests\n",
      "you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling\n",
      "accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary\n",
      "excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt\n",
      "securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of\n",
      "what you shall have for dinner--for all your meals for three years\n",

      "In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'\n",

      "But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as\n",

      "rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among\n",
      "the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were\n",
      "nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.  With bent head and\n",

      "But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in\n",
      "his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,\n",
      "almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:--\n",
      "\n",

      "While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\n",
      "slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\n",
      "to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile\n",
      "lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\n",
      "inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of\n",
      "his vitality in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the\n",
      "main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold\n",
      "with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: \"Whosoever\n",
      "of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a\n",

      "leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance\n",
      "at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man.\n",
      "That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick\n",

      "accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle\n",
      "if offered.\n",

      "One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be\n",

      "Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\n",

      "divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of\n",

      "great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the\n",
      "most widely distant points.\n",

      "It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships,\n",
      "and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by\n",
      "Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the\n",
      "Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted\n",
      "in the Greenland seas.  Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of\n",
      "these instances it has been declared that the interval of time\n",
      "between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.\n",
      "Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the\n",
      "Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to\n",
      "the whale.  So that here, in the real living experience of living\n",
      "men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello\n",
      "mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in\n",
      "which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still\n",
      "more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose\n",
      "waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an\n",
      "underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully\n",
      "equalled by the realities of the whalemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\n",
      "knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\n",
      "escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some\n",
      "whalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring\n",
      "Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but\n",
      "ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in\n",
      "his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should\n",
      "ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a\n",

      "wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.  These were\n",

      "While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over\n",
      "his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for\n",

      "an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National\n",
      "Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.  By that circular, it\n",
      "appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\n",
      "portions of it are presented in the circular.  \"This chart divides\n",
      "the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees\n",
      "of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are\n",
      "twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each\n",
      "of which districts are three lines; one to show the number of days\n",
      "that have been spent in each month in every district, and the two\n",

      "Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,\n",

      "secret intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in VEINS, as they are\n",
      "called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such\n",
      "undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any\n",
      "chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.  Though, in these\n",
      "cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a\n",
      "surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly\n",
      "confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary\n",
      "VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces\n",
      "some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to\n",
      "expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the\n",
      "whale-ship's mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic\n",

      "by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to\n",
      "be wholly without prospect of a meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\n",
      "delirious but still methodical scheme.  But not so in the reality,\n",
      "perhaps.  Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular\n",
      "seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude\n",
      "that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude\n",
      "this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those\n",
      "that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar\n",
      "and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved\n",
      "true.  In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,\n",
      "applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm\n",
      "whales.  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for\n",
      "example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,\n",
      "or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that\n",
      "were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent\n",
      "corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there.  So,\n",
      "too, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed\n",
      "himself.  But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and\n",
      "ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode.  And\n",
      "where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been\n",
      "spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side,\n",
      "antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or\n",

      "Africa; but to no purpose.  This man and this whale again came\n",
      "together, and the one vanquished the other.  I say I, myself, have\n",

      "In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian\n",

      "own times, a work every way of uncommon value.  By the best\n",

      "Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term\n",
      "of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\n",
      "in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having\n",
      "destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more\n",

      "Mediterranean.  I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary\n",
      "coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a\n",
      "sperm whale.  Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the\n",
      "Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out\n",

      "In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar\n",

      "But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm\n",
      "whale--squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because\n",
      "large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been\n",
      "found at its surface.  If, then, you properly put these statements\n",
      "together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,\n",

      "To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used\n",

      "It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was\n",

      "into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership,\n",
      "unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were\n",
      "brought to bear upon him.  Not only that, but the subtle insanity of\n",
      "Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested\n",
      "than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for\n",
      "the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange\n",
      "imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full\n",

      "playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous\n",
      "knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give\n",

      "this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright\n",

      "could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and\n",
      "yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing.  Besides he all the time\n",

      "mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast,\n",
      "acted like a charm upon the crew.  Then again, Stubb was one of those\n",

      "obeying them.\n",

      "were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron.  Beneath\n",

      "layer of water, also, the whales were swimming.  Seen in advance of\n",
      "all the other indications, the puffs of vapour they spouted, seemed\n",

      "All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled\n",

      "as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses.  He did\n",

      "separating their wakes.  The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck\n",
      "giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward.  Our sail was\n",
      "now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the boat\n",

      "sail collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapour shot up near\n",

      "into the white curdling cream of the squall.  Squall, whale, and\n",
      "harpoon had all blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the\n",
      "iron, escaped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed.  Swimming\n",
      "round it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the\n",

      "the sea, the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our\n",

      "to us from the bottom of the ocean.\n",

      "flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm.  Meanwhile the\n",
      "driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night;\n",
      "no sign of the ship could be seen.  The rising sea forbade all\n",
      "attempts to bale out the boat.  The oars were useless as propellers,\n",

      "working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small\n",
      "gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet\n",
      "continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any\n",

      "\"'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,\n",

      "now, I'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em.  They're playing\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket.  'Lively, boys,\n",
      "lively, now!'  And with that the pump clanged like fifty\n",
      "fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that\n",
      "peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest\n",
      "tension of life's utmost energies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman\n",
      "went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his\n",
      "face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from\n",
      "his brow.  Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed\n",
      "Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated\n",
      "state, I know not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding along\n",
      "the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the\n",
      "planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters\n",
      "consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of\n",
      "household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly\n",
      "attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case\n",
      "of ships actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the\n",
      "inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in\n",
      "seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing\n",
      "their faces.  But in all vessels this broom business is the\n",
      "prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.  Besides,\n",
      "it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into\n",
      "gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman\n",
      "of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of\n",
      "the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial\n",
      "business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the\n",
      "case with his comrades.  I mention all these particulars so that you\n",
      "may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost\n",
      "as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had\n",
      "spat in his face.  Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\n",
      "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\n",
      "fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.  But as he sat\n",
      "still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's\n",
      "malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in\n",
      "him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\n",
      "instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and\n",
      "unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already\n",
      "ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really\n",
      "valiant men even when aggrieved--this nameless phantom feeling,\n",
      "gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\n",
      "exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that\n",
      "sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.  And\n",
      "then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three\n",
      "lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the\n",
      "pumps, had done little or nothing all day.  To this, Radney replied\n",
      "with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner\n",
      "unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the\n",
      "still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper's club hammer which he\n",
      "had snatched from a cask near by.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps,\n",
      "for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating\n",
      "Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow\n",
      "still smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he\n",
      "remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed\n",
      "Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously\n",
      "commanding him to do his bidding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\n",
      "followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated\n",
      "his intention not to obey.  Seeing, however, that his forbearance had\n",
      "not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\n",
      "his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\n",
      "was to no purpose.  And in this way the two went once slowly round\n",
      "the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking\n",
      "him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the\n",
      "Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you.  Take that hammer away, or look to\n",
      "yourself.'  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,\n",
      "where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an\n",
      "inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable\n",
      "maledictions.  Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch;\n",
      "stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance,\n",
      "Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing\n",
      "it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek\n",
      "he (Steelkilt) would murder him.  But, gentlemen, the fool had been\n",
      "branded for the slaughter by the gods.  Immediately the hammer\n",
      "touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was\n",
      "stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays\n",

      "something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to\n",
      "the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is\n",
      "moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon\n",
      "there.  It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to\n",
      "those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the\n",
      "present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman.  It is\n",
      "time to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures\n",
      "of the whale all wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions\n",
      "will be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian\n",
      "sculptures.  For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times\n",
      "when on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues,\n",
      "and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in\n",
      "scales of chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St.\n",
      "George's; ever since then has something of the same sort of license\n",
      "prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in\n",
      "many scientific presentations of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\n",
      "to be the whale's, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\n",
      "Elephanta, in India.  The Brahmins maintain that in the almost\n",
      "endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and\n",
      "pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages\n",
      "before any of them actually came into being.  No wonder then, that in\n",
      "some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there\n",
      "shadowed forth.  The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate\n",
      "department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the\n",
      "form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.  But though\n",
      "this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the\n",

      "\n",
      "But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian\n",

      "undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water.  It has\n",
      "a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into\n",
      "which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate\n",
      "leading from the Thames by water into the Tower.  Then, there are the\n",
      "Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah's whale, as\n",
      "depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.\n",
      "What shall be said of these?  As for the book-binder's whale winding\n",
      "like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor--as stamped\n",
      "and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and\n",
      "new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,\n",
      "imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.  Though\n",
      "universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this\n",
      "book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended\n",
      "when the device was first introduced.  It was introduced by an old\n",
      "Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\n",
      "Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\n",

      "In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you\n",

      "of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled \"A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in\n",
      "the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.\"\n",
      "In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are\n",
      "represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over\n",
      "their living backs.  In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made\n",
      "of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\n",
      "Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled \"A Voyage round\n",
      "Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\n",
      "Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.\"  In this book is an outline purporting\n",
      "to be a \"Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale\n",
      "from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on\n",
      "deck.\"  I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for\n",
      "the benefit of his marines.  To mention but one thing about it, let\n",
      "me say that it has an eye which applied, according to the\n",
      "accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye\n",

      "Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for\n",
      "the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness\n",
      "of mistake.  Look at that popular work \"Goldsmith's Animated Nature.\"\n",
      "In the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an\n",
      "alleged \"whale\" and a \"narwhale.\"  I do not wish to seem inelegant,\n",
      "but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as\n",
      "for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in\n",
      "this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine\n",
      "upon any intelligent public of schoolboys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great\n",
      "naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\n",
      "several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan.  All\n",
      "these are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or\n",
      "Greenland whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a\n",

      "he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale.  Before showing\n",

      "the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he\n",
      "derived that picture, who can tell?  Perhaps he got it as his\n",
      "scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his\n",
      "authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing.  And what sort\n",

      "of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue\n",
      "paint.\n",

      "But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\n",
      "surprising after all.  Consider!  Most of the scientific drawings\n",
      "have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as\n",
      "correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would\n",
      "correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride\n",
      "of hull and spars.  Though elephants have stood for their\n",
      "full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated\n",
      "himself for his portrait.  The living whale, in his full majesty and\n",
      "significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and\n",
      "afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched\n",
      "line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing eternally\n",
      "impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to\n",
      "preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.  And, not to speak of\n",
      "the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking\n",
      "whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of\n",
      "one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is\n",
      "then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that\n",
      "his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\n",
      "whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form.  Not at\n",
      "all.  For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,\n",
      "that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape.\n",
      "Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the\n",
      "library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a\n",
      "burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other\n",
      "leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be\n",
      "inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones.  In fact, as the\n",
      "great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same\n",
      "relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does\n",
      "to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it.  This peculiarity\n",
      "is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will\n",
      "be incidentally shown.  It is also very curiously displayed in the\n",
      "side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the\n",
      "human hand, minus only the thumb.  This fin has four regular\n",
      "bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger.  But all\n",
      "these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human\n",
      "fingers in an artificial covering.  \"However recklessly the whale may\n",
      "sometimes serve us,\" said humorous Stubb one day, \"he can never be\n",
      "truly said to handle us without mittens.\"\n",

      "For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must\n",

      "world which must remain unpainted to the last.  True, one portrait\n",
      "may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with\n",
      "any very considerable degree of exactness.  So there is no earthly\n",
      "way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like.  And\n",
      "the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his\n",

      "bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the\n",

      "oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale,\n",
      "and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice.  The action of the\n",
      "whole thing is wonderfully good and true.  The half-emptied line-tub\n",
      "floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons\n",
      "obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered\n",
      "about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the\n",
      "black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene.\n",
      "Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this\n",

      "the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his\n",
      "black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the\n",
      "Patagonian cliffs.  His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so\n",
      "that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there\n",
      "must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below.  Sea fowls\n",
      "are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and\n",
      "maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent\n",
      "back.  And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing\n",

      "other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its\n",
      "consort.  Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common\n",
      "safety's sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached\n",
      "to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end\n",

      "like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are\n",
      "not so fastidious.  We all know how they live upon whales, and have\n",

      "on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after\n",
      "trying out the blubber.  Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are\n",
      "called \"fritters\"; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown\n",

      "nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had broken\n",
      "out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the plague,\n",
      "as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be stayed but\n",
      "according to his good pleasure.  The sailors, mostly poor devils,\n",
      "cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to his\n",
      "instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.\n",
      "Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are\n",
      "true.  Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to\n",
      "the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his\n",
      "measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others.  But\n",
      "it is time to return to the Pequod.\n",

      "\"Hast thou seen the White Whale?\" demanded Ahab, when the boat\n",
      "drifted back.\n",

      "as if dragged by fiends.  Nothing was said for some moments, while a\n",
      "succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those\n",
      "occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it.\n",
      "Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale's head jogged about very violently,\n",
      "and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than\n",
      "his archangel nature seemed to warrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story\n",
      "concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions\n",
      "from Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that\n",
      "seemed leagued with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon\n",
      "speaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the\n",
      "existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made.  Greedily sucking\n",
      "in this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against\n",
      "attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his\n",
      "gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being\n",
      "than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible.  But\n",
      "when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from\n",
      "the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter\n",
      "him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the\n",
      "opportunity, despite all the archangel's denunciations and\n",
      "forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.\n",
      "With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many\n",
      "perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one\n",
      "iron fast.  Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head,\n",
      "was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies\n",
      "of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity.  Now,\n",
      "while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat's bow, and with\n",
      "all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild\n",
      "exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for\n",
      "his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its\n",
      "quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the\n",
      "bodies of the oarsmen.  Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of\n",
      "furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc\n",
      "in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty\n",
      "yards.  Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any\n",
      "oarsman's head; but the mate for ever sank.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the\n",
      "Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.\n",
      "Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;\n",
      "oftener the boat's bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which\n",
      "the headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body.\n",
      "But strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances\n",
      "than one, when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of\n",
      "violence is discernible; the man being stark dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly\n",
      "descried from the ship.  Raising a piercing shriek--\"The vial! the\n",
      "vial!\"  Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further\n",
      "hunting of the whale.  This terrible event clothed the archangel with\n",
      "added influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had\n",
      "specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general\n",
      "prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit\n",
      "one of many marks in the wide margin allowed.  He became a nameless\n",
      "terror to the ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to\n",
      "him, that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he\n",
      "intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer.  To\n",
      "which Ahab answered--\"Aye.\"  Straightway, then, Gabriel once more\n",
      "started to his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently\n",
      "exclaimed, with downward pointed finger--\"Think, think of the\n",
      "blasphemer--dead, and down there!--beware of the blasphemer's end!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, \"Captain, I have\n",

      "Thus, most letters never reach their mark; and many are only\n",
      "received after attaining an age of two or three years or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand.  It was sorely\n",
      "tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in\n",
      "consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin.  Of such a\n",
      "letter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can'st not read it?\" cried Ahab.  \"Give it me, man.  Aye, aye, it's\n",
      "but a dim scrawl;--what's this?\"  As he was studying it out, Starbuck\n",
      "took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the\n",
      "end, to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the\n",
      "boat, without its coming any closer to the ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, \"Mr. Har--yes, Mr.\n",
      "Harry--(a woman's pinny hand,--the man's wife, I'll wager)--Aye--Mr.\n",

      "he caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the\n",
      "boat.  But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from\n",
      "rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship's stern; so that,\n",
      "as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel's eager\n",
      "hand.  He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and\n",
      "impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship.\n",
      "It fell at Ahab's feet.  Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to\n",

      "In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,\n",
      "there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew.  Now\n",
      "hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there.  There\n",
      "is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same time\n",
      "everything has to be done everywhere.  It is much the same with him\n",
      "who endeavors the description of the scene.  We must now retrace our\n",
      "way a little.  It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in\n",
      "the whale's back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original\n",
      "hole there cut by the spades of the mates.  But how did so clumsy and\n",

      "as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster's back for the special\n",
      "purpose referred to.  But in very many cases, circumstances require\n",
      "that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing\n",
      "or stripping operation is concluded.  The whale, be it observed, lies\n",
      "almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated\n",
      "upon.  So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the\n",
      "poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the\n",
      "water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him.  On\n",
      "the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume--a\n",
      "shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to\n",
      "uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as\n",
      "will presently be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the\n",
      "bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful\n",
      "duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon\n",
      "the dead whale's back.  You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a\n",
      "dancing-ape by a long cord.  Just so, from the ship's steep side, did\n",
      "I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called\n",
      "in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas\n",
      "belted round his waist.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a humorously perilous business for both of us.  For, before we\n",
      "proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at\n",
      "both ends; fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my\n",
      "narrow leather one.  So that for better or for worse, we two, for the\n",
      "time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more,\n",
      "then both usage and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord,\n",
      "it should drag me down in his wake.  So, then, an elongated Siamese\n",
      "ligature united us.  Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother;\n",
      "nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the\n",
      "hempen bond entailed.\n",

      "So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,\n",

      "company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and\n",
      "that another's mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into\n",

      "pills, you die.  True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you\n",
      "may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of\n",
      "life.  But handle Queequeg's monkey-rope heedfully as I would,\n",
      "sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard.\n",

      "incessant rolling and swaying of both.  But this was not the only\n",
      "jamming jeopardy he was exposed to.  Unappalled by the massacre made\n",
      "upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly\n",
      "allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the\n",
      "carcass--the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.\n",

      "then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of\n",

      "another protection.  Suspended over the side in one of the stages,\n",
      "Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of\n",
      "keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they\n",
      "could reach.  This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very\n",
      "disinterested and benevolent of them.  They meant Queequeg's best\n",
      "happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from\n",
      "the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half\n",
      "hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs\n",
      "would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall.  But poor Queequeg, I\n",
      "suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook--poor\n",

      "sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the\n",

      "For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while\n",
      "they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still\n",

      "her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings,\n",
      "that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the\n",
      "whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to\n",
      "fly.  But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering his\n",

      "Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us\n",
      "join them, and lay together our own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\n",
      "Whale are by far the most noteworthy.  They are the only whales\n",
      "regularly hunted by man.  To the Nantucketer, they present the two\n",
      "extremes of all the known varieties of the whale.  As the external\n",
      "difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a\n",
      "head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod's side; and as we\n",
      "may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the\n",
      "deck:--where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance\n",
      "to study practical cetology than here?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\n",
      "these heads.  Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there\n",
      "is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the\n",
      "Right Whale's sadly lacks.  There is more character in the Sperm\n",
      "Whale's head.  As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense\n",
      "superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity.  In the present\n",
      "instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt\n",
      "colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and\n",
      "large experience.  In short, he is what the fishermen technically\n",
      "call a \"grey-headed whale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the\n",
      "two most important organs, the eye and the ear.  Far back on the side\n",
      "of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if\n",
      "you narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you\n",
      "would fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it\n",
      "to the magnitude of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is\n",
      "plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\n",
      "than he can one exactly astern.  In a word, the position of the\n",
      "whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy,\n",
      "for yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey\n",
      "objects through your ears.  You would find that you could only\n",
      "command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight\n",
      "side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it.  If your\n",
      "bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted\n",
      "in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if he\n",
      "were stealing upon you from behind.  In a word, you would have two\n",
      "backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side\n",
      "fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man--what, indeed,\n",
      "but his eyes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the\n",
      "eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so\n",
      "as to produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar\n",
      "position of the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many\n",
      "cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a great\n",
      "mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must\n",
      "wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts.\n",
      "The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side,\n",
      "and another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be\n",
      "profound darkness and nothingness to him.  Man may, in effect, be\n",
      "said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined\n",
      "sashes for his window.  But with the whale, these two sashes are\n",
      "separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing\n",
      "the view.  This peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing always to\n",
      "be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader\n",
      "in some subsequent scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\n",
      "visual matter as touching the Leviathan.  But I must be content with\n",
      "a hint.  So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of\n",
      "seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically\n",
      "seeing whatever objects are before him.  Nevertheless, any one's\n",
      "experience will teach him, that though he can take in an\n",
      "undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite\n",
      "impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two\n",
      "things--however large or however small--at one and the same instant\n",
      "of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other.\n",
      "But if you now come to separate these two objects, and surround each\n",
      "by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them,\n",
      "in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will\n",
      "be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness.  How is it,\n",
      "then, with the whale?  True, both his eyes, in themselves, must\n",
      "simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,\n",
      "combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same moment of\n",
      "time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of\n",
      "him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?  If he can, then\n",
      "is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\n",
      "simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\n",
      "problems in Euclid.  Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\n",
      "incongruity in this comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\n",
      "extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\n",
      "beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\n",
      "frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\n",
      "proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\n",
      "divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye.  If you are\n",
      "an entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads\n",
      "for hours, and never discover that organ.  The ear has no external\n",
      "leaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a\n",
      "quill, so wondrously minute is it.  It is lodged a little behind the\n",
      "eye.  With respect to their ears, this important difference is to be\n",
      "observed between the sperm whale and the right.  While the ear of\n",
      "the former has an external opening, that of the latter is entirely\n",
      "and evenly covered over with a membrane, so as to be quite\n",
      "imperceptible from without.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the\n",
      "world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear\n",
      "which is smaller than a hare's?  But if his eyes were broad as the\n",
      "lens of Herschel's great telescope; and his ears capacious as the\n",
      "porches of cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or\n",
      "sharper of hearing?  Not at all.--Why then do you try to \"enlarge\"\n",
      "your mind?  Subtilize it.\n",

      "mouth; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from\n",

      "inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe.  Two hundred\n",
      "years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a\n",
      "shoemaker's last.  And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of\n",

      "different aspects, according to your point of view.  If you stand on\n",
      "its summit and look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take\n",
      "the whole head for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the\n",
      "apertures in its sounding-board.  Then, again, if you fix your eye\n",
      "upon this strange, crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the\n",
      "mass--this green, barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the\n",
      "\"crown,\" and the Southern fishers the \"bonnet\" of the Right Whale;\n",
      "fixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for the\n",
      "trunk of some huge oak, with a bird's nest in its crotch.  At any\n",
      "rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this\n",

      "bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in\n",
      "thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the\n",
      "sea, whose green crown has been put together for him in this\n",
      "marvellous manner.  But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky\n",

      "what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter's\n",

      "Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah went?  The roof is about\n",
      "twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were\n",
      "a regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides,\n",
      "present us with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats\n",
      "of whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which depending from the\n",
      "upper part of the head or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds\n",
      "which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned.  The edges of these\n",
      "bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right Whale\n",
      "strains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small\n",
      "fish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding\n",
      "time.  In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural\n",
      "order, there are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges,\n",
      "whereby some whalemen calculate the creature's age, as the age of an\n",
      "oak by its circular rings.  Though the certainty of this criterion is\n",
      "far from demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical\n",

      "all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you\n",
      "not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing\n",
      "upon its thousand pipes?  For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of\n",

      "You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm\n",

      "as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin.  Moreover you\n",
      "observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he\n",

      "distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know,\n",

      "packed rush was made to the side, and every eye counted every ripple,\n",
      "as moment followed moment, and no sign of either the sinker or the\n",

      "and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian.  Drawn into\n",
      "the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego\n",
      "was long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished?  Why, diving after\n",

      "side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there;\n",
      "then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and\n",
      "upwards, and so hauled out poor Tash by the head.  He averred, that\n",
      "upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well\n",
      "knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great\n",
      "trouble;--he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and\n",
      "toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next\n",
      "trial, he came forth in the good old way--head foremost.  As for the\n",
      "great head itself, that was doing as well as could be expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of\n",

      "deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing\n",

      "which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow\n",

      "directly communicates with the brain.  And what is still more, for\n",
      "many feet after emerging from the brain's cavity, the spinal cord\n",

      "not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.\n",
      "Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water\n",
      "must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad\n",
      "muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile\n",
      "currents meet.  His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming\n",
      "forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn\n",
      "shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which\n",

      "barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that often torments\n",
      "the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his\n",
      "foes.  Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be\n",
      "doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but\n",
      "reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under\n",
      "water, the more he is exhausted.  Because, owing to the enormous\n",
      "surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000\n",
      "square feet--the pressure of the water is immense.  We all know what\n",
      "an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even\n",
      "here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a\n",
      "whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean!\n",
      "It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres.  One whaleman\n",

      "depths; what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that\n",
      "silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing\n",
      "and wrenching in agony!  Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were\n",
      "visible at the bows.  Seems it credible that by three such thin\n",

      "eight day clock.  Suspended? and to what?  To three bits of board.\n",

      "so that every oarsman felt them in his seat.  The next moment,\n",

      "ship's lengths of the hunters.\n",
      "\n",
      "His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion.  In most land\n",
      "animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their\n",
      "veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least\n",
      "instantly shut off in certain directions.  Not so with the whale; one\n",
      "of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure\n",
      "of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point\n",
      "as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole\n",
      "arterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary\n",
      "pressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life may\n",
      "be said to pour from him in incessant streams.  Yet so vast is the\n",
      "quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior\n",
      "fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a\n",
      "considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose\n",
      "source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills.\n",
      "Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew\n",
      "over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they\n",
      "were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept\n",
      "continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was\n",
      "only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture\n",
      "into the air.  From this last vent no blood yet came, because no\n",
      "vital part of him had thus far been struck.  His life, as they\n",
      "significantly call it, was untouched.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of\n",
      "his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly\n",
      "revealed.  His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been,\n",
      "were beheld.  As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of\n",
      "the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's\n",
      "eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable\n",
      "to see.  But pity there was none.  For all his old age, and his one\n",
      "arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in\n",
      "order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and\n",
      "also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional\n",
      "inoffensiveness by all to all.  Still rolling in his blood, at last\n",
      "he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance,\n",
      "the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A nice spot,\" cried Flask; \"just let me prick him there once.\"\n",

      "\"Avast!\" cried Starbuck, \"there's no need of that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But humane Starbuck was too late.  At the instant of the dart an\n",
      "ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more\n",
      "than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with\n",
      "swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their\n",
      "glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat\n",
      "and marring the bows.  It was his death stroke.  For, by this time,\n",
      "so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from\n",
      "the wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped\n",
      "with his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a\n",
      "waning world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a\n",
      "log, and died.  It was most piteous, that last expiring spout.  As\n",
      "when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some\n",
      "mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the\n",
      "spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground--so the last long dying\n",
      "spout of the whale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\n",
      "showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.\n",
      "Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at\n",
      "different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\n",
      "whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords.  By\n",
      "very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was\n",
      "transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the\n",
      "stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially\n",
      "upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the\n",
      "spade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in\n",
      "his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described.  But as\n",
      "the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of\n",
      "captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no\n",
      "prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must\n",
      "needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully\n",
      "to account for the ulceration alluded to.  But still more curious was\n",
      "the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from\n",
      "the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it.  Who had darted\n",
      "that stone lance?  And when?  It might have been darted by some Nor'\n",
      "West Indian long before America was discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\n",
      "cabinet there is no telling.  But a sudden stop was put to further\n",
      "discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over\n",
      "sideways to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing\n",
      "tendency to sink.  However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of\n",
      "affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely,\n",
      "indeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if\n",
      "still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the\n",
      "command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable\n",
      "strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables\n",

      "and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?\" cried Stubb to the body, \"don't be in\n",

      "Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\n",
      "Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\n",
      "accounted for it.  Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\n",
      "buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\n",
      "surface.  If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\n",
      "broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\n",
      "bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert\n",
      "that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the\n",
      "fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in\n",
      "him.  But it is not so.  For young whales, in the highest health, and\n",
      "swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm\n",
      "flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even\n",

      "twenty Right Whales do.  This difference in the species is no doubt\n",
      "imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the\n",
      "Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a\n",
      "ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free.  But there\n",
      "are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days,\n",
      "the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life.  But the\n",
      "reason of this is obvious.  Gases are generated in him; he swells to\n",
      "a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon.  A\n",

      "story was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,\n",
      "embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which\n",
      "represented Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity\n",

      "fishermen have this saying, \"A penny roll would choke him\"; his\n",
      "swallow is so very small.  But, to this, Bishop Jebb's anticipative\n",
      "answer is ready.  It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we\n",
      "consider Jonah as tombed in the whale's belly, but as temporarily\n",
      "lodged in some part of his mouth.  And this seems reasonable enough\n",
      "in the good Bishop.  For truly, the Right Whale's mouth would\n",
      "accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the\n",
      "players.  Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a\n",
      "hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.\n",

      "Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his\n",

      "in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices.\n",
      "But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German\n",
      "exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating\n",
      "body of a DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian\n",
      "campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them.\n",
      "Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that\n",
      "when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway\n",
      "effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a\n",
      "whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called \"The\n",
      "Whale,\" as some craft are nowadays christened the \"Shark,\" the\n",

      "right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and\n",
      "after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days'\n",

      "passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another\n",

      "That for six thousand years--and no one knows how many millions of\n",
      "ages before--the great whales should have been spouting all over the\n",
      "sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with\n",
      "so many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries\n",
      "back, thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of\n",
      "the whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings--that all this\n",
      "should be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a\n",
      "quarter minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of\n",
      "December, A.D. 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these\n",
      "spoutings are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapour--this is\n",
      "surely a noteworthy thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items\n",
      "contingent.  Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\n",
      "gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times\n",
      "is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or\n",
      "a cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the\n",
      "surface.  But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him\n",
      "regular lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live by\n",
      "inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere.  Wherefore the\n",
      "necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world.  But he\n",
      "cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary\n",
      "attitude, the Sperm Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet\n",
      "beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no\n",
      "connexion with his mouth.  No, he breathes through his spiracle\n",
      "alone; and this is on the top of his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\n",
      "indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\n",
      "certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with\n",
      "the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not\n",
      "think I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous\n",
      "scientific words.  Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in\n",
      "a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his\n",
      "nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time.  That is to\n",
      "say, he would then live without breathing.  Anomalous as it may seem,\n",
      "this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives,\n",
      "by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without\n",
      "drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle\n",
      "of air; for, remember, he has no gills.  How is this?  Between his\n",
      "ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable\n",
      "involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels,\n",
      "when he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated\n",
      "blood.  So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea,\n",
      "he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel\n",
      "crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for\n",
      "future use in its four supplementary stomachs.  The anatomical fact\n",
      "of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded\n",
      "upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I\n",
      "consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in\n",
      "HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase it.  This is what I\n",
      "mean.  If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale\n",
      "will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his\n",
      "other unmolested risings.  Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets\n",
      "seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he\n",
      "rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again,\n",
      "to a minute.  Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,\n",
      "so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good\n",
      "his regular allowance of air.  And not till those seventy breaths are\n",
      "told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below.\n",
      "Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are\n",
      "different; but in any one they are alike.  Now, why should the whale\n",
      "thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish\n",
      "his reservoir of air, ere descending for good?  How obvious is it,\n",
      "too, that this necessity for the whale's rising exposes him to all\n",
      "the fatal hazards of the chase.  For not by hook or by net could\n",
      "this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms\n",
      "beneath the sunlight.  Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the\n",
      "great necessities that strike the victory to thee!\n",
      "\n",
      "In man, breathing is incessantly going on--one breath only serving\n",
      "for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has\n",
      "to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will.\n",
      "But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;\n",
      "if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,\n",
      "then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of\n",
      "smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at\n",
      "all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so\n",
      "clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power\n",
      "of smelling.  But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be\n",
      "water or whether it be vapour--no absolute certainty can as yet be\n",
      "arrived at on this head.  Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm\n",
      "Whale has no proper olfactories.  But what does he want of them?  No\n",
      "roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his\n",
      "spouting canal, and as that long canal--like the grand Erie Canal--is\n",
      "furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward\n",
      "retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the\n",
      "whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so\n",
      "strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose.  But then again, what\n",
      "has the whale to say?  Seldom have I known any profound being that\n",
      "had anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out\n",
      "something by way of getting a living.  Oh! happy that the world is\n",
      "such an excellent listener!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is\n",
      "for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\n",
      "horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a\n",
      "little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe\n",
      "laid down in a city on one side of a street.  But the question\n",
      "returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words,\n",
      "whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled\n",
      "breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in\n",
      "at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle.  It is certain\n",
      "that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but\n",
      "it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water\n",
      "through the spiracle.  Because the greatest necessity for so doing\n",
      "would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water.\n",
      "But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath the surface, and there he\n",
      "cannot spout even if he would.  Besides, if you regard him very\n",
      "closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when\n",
      "unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his\n",
      "jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?  Speak\n",
      "out!  You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can\n",
      "you not tell water from air?  My dear sir, in this world it is not so\n",
      "easy to settle these plain things.  I have ever found your plain\n",
      "things the knottiest of all.  And as for this whale spout, you might\n",
      "almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist\n",
      "enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls\n",
      "from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a\n",
      "close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water\n",
      "cascading all around him.  And if at such times you should think that\n",
      "you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know\n",
      "that they are not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know\n",
      "that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the\n",
      "spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the\n",
      "whale's head?  For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day\n",
      "sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in\n",
      "the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of\n",
      "water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a\n",
      "cavity in a rock filled up with rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching\n",
      "the precise nature of the whale spout.  It will not do for him to be\n",
      "peering into it, and putting his face in it.  You cannot go with your\n",
      "pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away.  For even\n",
      "when coming into slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the\n",
      "jet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from\n",
      "the acridness of the thing so touching it.  And I know one, who\n",
      "coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some\n",
      "scientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin\n",
      "peeled off from his cheek and arm.  Wherefore, among whalemen, the\n",
      "spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it.  Another thing; I\n",
      "have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is\n",
      "fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.  The wisest thing\n",
      "the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly\n",
      "spout alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish.  My\n",
      "hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist.  And besides\n",
      "other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations\n",
      "touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;\n",
      "I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an\n",
      "undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores;\n",
      "all other whales sometimes are.  He is both ponderous and profound.\n",
      "And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound\n",

      "there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act\n",
      "of thinking deep thoughts.  While composing a little treatise on\n",
      "Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere\n",
      "long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and undulation\n",
      "in the atmosphere over my head.  The invariable moisture of my hair,\n",
      "while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin\n",
      "shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument\n",
      "for the above supposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\n",
      "behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast,\n",
      "mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour, engendered by his\n",
      "incommunicable contemplations, and that vapour--as you will sometimes\n",
      "see it--glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal\n",
      "upon his thoughts.  For, d'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear\n",
      "air; they only irradiate vapour.  And so, through all the thick mists\n",
      "of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot,\n",
      "enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray.  And for this I thank God; for\n",
      "all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along with\n",
      "them, have intuitions.  Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions\n",

      "Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,\n",
      "and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less\n",
      "celestial, I celebrate a tail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point\n",
      "of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it\n",
      "comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty\n",
      "square feet.  The compact round body of its root expands into two\n",
      "broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less\n",
      "than an inch in thickness.  At the crotch or junction, these flukes\n",
      "slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings,\n",
      "leaving a wide vacancy between.  In no living thing are the lines of\n",
      "beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of\n",
      "these flukes.  At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the\n",
      "tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\n",
      "into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:--upper,\n",
      "middle, and lower.  The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are\n",
      "long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\n",
      "crosswise between the outside layers.  This triune structure, as much\n",
      "as anything else, imparts power to the tail.  To the student of old\n",
      "Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the\n",
      "thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those\n",
      "wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so\n",
      "much to the great strength of the masonry.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not\n",
      "enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and\n",
      "woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side\n",
      "the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with\n",
      "them, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the\n",
      "confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to\n",
      "a point.  Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to\n",
      "do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the\n",
      "graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease\n",

      "never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in\n",

      "sweeping; Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\n",
      "\n",
      "First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in\n",
      "a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures.  It\n",
      "never wriggles.  In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority.\n",
      "To the whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion.  Scroll-wise\n",
      "coiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards,\n",
      "it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the\n",
      "monster when furiously swimming.  His side-fins only serve to steer\n",
      "by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\n",
      "fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in\n",
      "his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail.\n",
      "In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and\n",
      "the blow is only inflicted by the recoil.  If it be made in the\n",
      "unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is\n",
      "then simply irresistible.  No ribs of man or boat can withstand it.\n",
      "Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways\n",
      "through the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy\n",
      "of the whale boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked\n",
      "rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is\n",
      "generally the most serious result.  These submerged side blows are so\n",
      "often received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child's\n",
      "play.  Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\n",
      "the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\n",
      "there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\n",
      "elephant's trunk.  This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\n",
      "sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\n",
      "slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\n",
      "the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,\n",
      "whiskers and all.  What tenderness there is in that preliminary\n",
      "touch!  Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway\n",
      "bethink me of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the\n",
      "flower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to\n",
      "damsels, and then caressed their zones.  On more accounts than one, a\n",
      "pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in\n",
      "his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded\n",
      "in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of\n",
      "the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast\n",
      "corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as\n",
      "if it were a hearth.  But still you see his power in his play.  The\n",
      "broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting\n",
      "the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles.  You would\n",
      "almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the\n",
      "light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity, you\n",
      "would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the\n",
      "flukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then\n",
      "completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to\n",
      "plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of\n",
      "his body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a\n",
      "moment, till they downwards shoot out of view.  Excepting the sublime\n",
      "BREACH--somewhere else to be described--this peaking of the whale's\n",
      "flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated\n",
      "nature.  Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems\n",
      "spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven.  So in dreams, have I\n",
      "seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from\n",

      "you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels.  Standing at the mast-head\n",
      "of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a\n",
      "large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and\n",
      "for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.  As it seemed\n",
      "to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods\n",
      "was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers.\n",
      "As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then\n",
      "testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all\n",
      "beings.  For according to King Juba, the military elephants of\n",

      "the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and\n",
      "in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such\n",
      "fancy as the above seemed his.  And when he glanced upon the green\n",

      "side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the\n",

      "the three keels that were after them,--though as yet a mile in their\n",
      "rear,--than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and\n",

      "animating token that they were now at last under the influence of\n",
      "that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the\n",
      "fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied.  The\n",
      "compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and\n",
      "steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and\n",
      "like King Porus' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they\n",
      "seemed going mad with consternation.  In all directions expanding in\n",
      "vast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by\n",
      "their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction\n",
      "of panic.  This was still more strangely evinced by those of their\n",
      "number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like\n",
      "water-logged dismantled ships on the sea.  Had these Leviathans been\n",
      "but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce\n",
      "wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay.\n",
      "But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding\n",
      "creatures.  Though banding together in tens of thousands, the\n",
      "lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary\n",
      "horseman.  Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together\n",
      "in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the slightest\n",
      "alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,\n",
      "trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death.\n",
      "Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied\n",

      "which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\n",
      "yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced\n",
      "nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place.  As is\n",
      "customary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making\n",
      "for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal.  In about\n",
      "three minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish\n",
      "darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like\n",
      "light, steered straight for the heart of the herd.  Though such a\n",
      "movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is\n",
      "in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less\n",
      "anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous\n",
      "vicissitudes of the fishery.  For as the swift monster drags you\n",
      "deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to\n",
      "circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.\n",
      "\n",
      "As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power\n",
      "of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him;\n",
      "as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we\n",
      "flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset\n",
      "boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving\n",
      "to steer through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at\n",
      "what moment it may be locked in and crushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\n",
      "from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging\n",
      "away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while\n",
      "all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking\n",
      "out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for\n",
      "there was no time to make long ones.  Nor were the oarsmen quite\n",
      "idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.\n",
      "They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business.  \"Out of\n",
      "the way, Commodore!\" cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden\n",
      "rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp\n",
      "us.  \"Hard down with your tail, there!\" cried a second to another,\n",
      "which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his\n",
      "own fan-like extremity.\n",
      "\n",
      "All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally\n",
      "invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs.  Two thick squares\n",
      "of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they\n",
      "cross each other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable\n",
      "length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other\n",
      "end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a\n",
      "harpoon.  It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used.\n",
      "For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly\n",
      "chase at one time.  But sperm whales are not every day encountered;\n",
      "while you may, then, you must kill all you can.  And if you cannot\n",
      "kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be\n",
      "afterwards killed at your leisure.  Hence it is, that at times like\n",
      "these the drugg, comes into requisition.  Our boat was furnished with\n",
      "three of them.  The first and second were successfully darted, and we\n",
      "saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous\n",
      "sidelong resistance of the towing drugg.  They were cramped like\n",
      "malefactors with the chain and ball.  But upon flinging the third, in\n",
      "the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under\n",
      "one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and\n",
      "carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the\n",
      "seat slid from under him.  On both sides the sea came in at the\n",
      "wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in,\n",
      "and so stopped the leaks for the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were\n",
      "it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly\n",
      "diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from\n",
      "the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning.\n",
      "So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing\n",
      "whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting\n",
      "momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of\n",
      "the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\n",
      "valley lake.  Here the storms in the roaring glens between the\n",
      "outermost whales, were heard but not felt.  In this central expanse\n",
      "the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek,\n",
      "produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more\n",
      "quiet moods.  Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say\n",
      "lurks at the heart of every commotion.  And still in the distracted\n",
      "distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and\n",
      "saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going\n",
      "round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so\n",
      "closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might\n",
      "easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on\n",
      "their backs.  Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales,\n",
      "more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no\n",
      "possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.  We must watch\n",
      "for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had\n",
      "only admitted us in order to shut us up.  Keeping at the centre of\n",
      "the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves;\n",

      "another ship) came up with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and\n",
      "finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs.  And\n",
      "when those defendants were remonstrated with, their captain snapped\n",

      "wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife's\n",
      "viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in\n",
      "the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action\n",
      "to recover possession of her.  Erskine was on the other side; and he\n",
      "then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally\n",
      "harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of\n",
      "the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned\n",
      "her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and\n",

      "\"I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here won't\n",
      "believe it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer\n",
      "before.  But come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if he won't\n",
      "me; and so I'll get out of this dirty scrape.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,\" rejoined\n",
      "Stubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck.  There a queer\n",
      "scene presented itself.  The sailors, in tasselled caps of red\n",
      "worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales.\n",
      "But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in\n",
      "anything but a good humor.  All their noses upwardly projected from\n",
      "their faces like so many jib-booms.  Now and then pairs of them would\n",
      "drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air.\n",
      "Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar,\n",
      "and at intervals held it to their nostrils.  Others having broken the\n",
      "stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously\n",
      "puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their\n",
      "olfactories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding\n",
      "from the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction\n",
      "saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar\n",
      "from within.  This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\n",
      "remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\n",
      "to the Captain's round-house (CABINET he called it) to avoid the\n",
      "pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\n",
      "indignations at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to\n",
      "the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the\n",
      "stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited\n",
      "ignoramus, who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable\n",
      "a pickle.  Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the\n",
      "Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the\n",
      "ambergris.  He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise\n",
      "was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly\n",
      "concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the\n",
      "Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.\n",
      "According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under\n",
      "cover of an interpreter's office, was to tell the Captain what he\n",
      "pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter\n",
      "any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin.  He was a\n",
      "small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain,\n",
      "with large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton\n",
      "velvet vest with watch-seals at his side.  To this gentleman, Stubb\n",
      "was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once\n",
      "ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall I say to him first?\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why,\" said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,\n",
      "\"you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish\n",
      "to me, though I don't pretend to be a judge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur,\" said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\n",
      "captain, \"that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain\n",
      "and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from\n",
      "a blasted whale they had brought alongside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\n",
      "carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a\n",
      "whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey.  In fact, tell him from me he's a\n",
      "baboon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,\n",
      "is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he\n",
      "conjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\n",
      "crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast\n",
      "loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in\n",
      "fact, tell him I've diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps\n",
      "somebody else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service\n",
      "to us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties\n",
      "(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down\n",
      "into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,\" said the\n",
      "interpreter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink\n",
      "with the man I've diddled.  In fact, tell him I must go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking;\n",
      "but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then\n",
      "Monsieur had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from\n",
      "these whales, for it's so calm they won't drift.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat,\n",
      "hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line\n",
      "in his boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out\n",
      "the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side.  While the\n",
      "Frenchman's boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way,\n",
      "Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,\n",
      "ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the\n",
      "whale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance,\n",
      "while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale.  Whereupon\n",
      "Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to\n",
      "give notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of\n",
      "his unrighteous cunning.  Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced\n",
      "an excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin.  You would\n",
      "almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and\n",
      "when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like\n",
      "turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam.\n",
      "His boat's crew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their\n",
      "chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.\n",
      "\n",
      "And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\n",
      "screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them.  Stubb was\n",
      "beginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay\n",
      "increased, when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague,\n",
      "there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide\n",
      "of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow\n",
      "into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for\n",
      "a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have it, I have it,\" cried Stubb, with delight, striking something\n",
      "in the subterranean regions, \"a purse! a purse!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of\n",
      "something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old\n",
      "cheese; very unctuous and savory withal.  You might easily dent it\n",
      "with your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour.  And\n",
      "this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any\n",
      "druggist.  Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably\n",
      "lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured\n",
      "were it not for impatient Ahab's loud command to Stubb to desist, and\n",
      "come on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.\n",

      "Ambergris.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as\n",
      "an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\n",
      "Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on\n",
      "that subject.  For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively\n",
      "late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber\n",
      "itself, a problem to the learned.  Though the word ambergris is but\n",
      "the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite\n",
      "distinct.  For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also\n",
      "dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found\n",
      "except upon the sea.  Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle,\n",
      "odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and\n",
      "ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and\n",
      "spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious\n",
      "candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.  The Turks use it in cooking, and\n",
      "also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is\n",
      "carried to St. Peter's in Rome.  Some wine merchants drop a few\n",
      "grains into claret, to flavor it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should\n",
      "regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a\n",
      "sick whale!  Yet so it is.  By some, ambergris is supposed to be the\n",
      "cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale.  How\n",
      "to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering\n",
      "three or four boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out\n",
      "of harm's way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,\n",
      "certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might\n",
      "be sailors' trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they\n",
      "were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\n",
      "found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing?  Bethink thee of\n",
      "that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and\n",
      "incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory.\n",
      "And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is\n",
      "that maketh the best musk.  Also forget not the strange fact that of\n",
      "all things of ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental\n",
      "manufacturing stages, is the worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but\n",
      "cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against\n",
      "whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,\n",
      "might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said\n",
      "of the Frenchman's two whales.  Elsewhere in this volume the\n",
      "slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling\n",
      "is throughout a slatternly, untidy business.  But there is another\n",
      "thing to rebut.  They hint that all whales always smell bad.  Now how\n",
      "did this odious stigma originate?\n",
      "\n",
      "I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\n",
      "Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago.\n",
      "Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their\n",
      "oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the\n",
      "fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of\n",
      "large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the\n",
      "season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which\n",
      "they are exposed, forbidding any other course.  The consequence is,\n",
      "that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale\n",
      "cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat\n",
      "similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, for\n",
      "the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\n",
      "likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in\n",
      "former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg,\n",
      "which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in\n",
      "his great work on Smells, a text-book on that subject.  As its name\n",
      "imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in\n",
      "order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to\n",
      "be tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose.\n",
      "It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when\n",
      "the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very\n",
      "pleasant savor.  But all this is quite different with a South Sea\n",
      "Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after\n",
      "completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume\n",
      "fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it\n",
      "is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.  The truth is, that living or\n",
      "dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means\n",
      "creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people\n",
      "of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the\n",
      "nose.  Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,\n",
      "when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking\n",
      "abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,\n",
      "seldom in the open air.  I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's\n",
      "flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady\n",
      "rustles her dress in a warm parlor.  What then shall I liken the\n",
      "Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?  Must it not\n",
      "be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with\n",
      "myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honour to Alexander\n",

      "driven in one eccentric span.  But while hapless Dough-Boy was by\n",

      "tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant,\n",
      "genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever\n",
      "enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any\n",

      "Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for\n",
      "even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony,\n",
      "panelled in king's cabinets.  But Pip loved life, and all life's\n",
      "peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he\n",
      "had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred\n",
      "his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus\n",
      "temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly\n",
      "illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to\n",
      "ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County\n",

      "green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the\n",

      "clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the\n",
      "pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning\n",
      "jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he\n",
      "lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the\n",
      "sun, but by some unnatural gases.  Then come out those fiery\n",
      "effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once\n",
      "the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel\n",
      "stolen from the King of Hell.  But let us to the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman\n",
      "chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;\n",
      "and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\n",
      "but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\n",
      "therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb\n",
      "observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his\n",
      "courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\n",
      "the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\n",
      "happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat.  The\n",
      "involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\n",
      "hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack\n",
      "whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with\n",
      "him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the\n",
      "water.  That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the\n",
      "line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up\n",
      "to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,\n",
      "which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tashtego stood in the bows.  He was full of the fire of the hunt.  He\n",
      "hated Pip for a poltroon.  Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,\n",
      "he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\n",
      "exclaimed interrogatively, \"Cut?\"  Meantime Pip's blue, choked face\n",
      "plainly looked, Do, for God's sake!  All passed in a flash.  In less\n",
      "than half a minute, this entire thing happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Damn him, cut!\" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\n",
      "saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed\n",
      "by yells and execrations from the crew.  Tranquilly permitting these\n",
      "irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,\n",
      "business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;\n",
      "and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice.  The\n",
      "substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest\n",
      "was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is.  Now, in general,\n",
      "STICK TO THE BOAT, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will\n",
      "sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT, is still better.  Moreover,\n",
      "as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted\n",
      "conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a\n",
      "margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice,\n",
      "and concluded with a peremptory command, \"Stick to the boat, Pip, or\n",
      "by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that.  We can't\n",
      "afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for\n",
      "thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.  Bear that in mind, and\n",
      "don't jump any more.\"  Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that\n",
      "though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which\n",

      "started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried\n",

      "finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul.  Not drowned\n",
      "entirely, though.  Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths,\n",
      "where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro\n",
      "before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his\n",

      "eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral\n",
      "insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal\n",
      "orbs.  He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it;\n",

      "standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed\n",
      "to the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own\n",
      "boat's bow.  He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured,\n",
      "fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious\n",
      "roundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and\n",

      "\"Hast seen the White Whale!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Man my boat!\" cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars\n",

      "\n",
      "In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his\n",
      "crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the\n",
      "stranger.  But here a curious difficulty presented itself.  In the\n",
      "excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of\n",
      "his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but\n",
      "his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy\n",
      "mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be\n",
      "rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment's warning.  Now,\n",
      "it is no very easy matter for anybody--except those who are almost\n",
      "hourly used to it, like whalemen--to clamber up a ship's side from a\n",
      "boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up\n",
      "towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down\n",
      "to the kelson.  So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of\n",
      "course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab\n",
      "now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again;\n",
      "hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope\n",
      "to attain.\n",

      "It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\n",
      "circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\n",
      "luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab.\n",
      "And in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of\n",
      "the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\n",
      "perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him\n",
      "a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not\n",
      "seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a\n",
      "cripple to use their sea bannisters.  But this awkwardness only\n",
      "lasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a glance\n",
      "how affairs stood, cried out, \"I see, I see!--avast heaving there!\n",
      "Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or\n",
      "two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive\n",
      "curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the\n",
      "end.  This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it\n",
      "all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like\n",
      "sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree),\n",
      "and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time\n",
      "also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon\n",
      "one of the running parts of the tackle.  Soon he was carefully swung\n",
      "inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head.\n",
      "With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain\n",
      "advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory\n",
      "arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, \"Aye,\n",
      "aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!--an arm and a leg!--an arm\n",
      "that never can shrink, d'ye see; and a leg that never can run.  Where\n",
      "did'st thou see the White Whale?--how long ago?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The White Whale,\" said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm\n",
      "towards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had\n",
      "been a telescope; \"there I saw him, on the Line, last season.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And he took that arm off, did he?\" asked Ahab, now sliding down from\n",
      "the capstan, and resting on the Englishman's shoulder, as he did so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spin me the yarn,\" said Ahab; \"how was it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,\"\n",
      "began the Englishman.  \"I was ignorant of the White Whale at that\n",
      "time.  Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and\n",
      "my boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too,\n",
      "that went milling and milling round so, that my boat's crew could\n",
      "only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale.\n",
      "Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great\n",
      "whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all crows' feet and\n",
      "wrinkles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was he, it was he!\" cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his\n",
      "suspended breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye--they were mine--MY irons,\" cried Ahab, exultingly--\"but\n",
      "on!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me a chance, then,\" said the Englishman, good-humoredly.\n",
      "\"Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs\n",
      "all afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my\n",
      "fast-line!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, I see!--wanted to part it; free the fast-fish--an old trick--I\n",
      "know him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How it was exactly,\" continued the one-armed commander, \"I do not\n",
      "know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there\n",
      "somehow; but we didn't know it then; so that when we afterwards\n",
      "pulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of\n",
      "the other whale's; that went off to windward, all fluking.  Seeing\n",
      "how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was--the noblest\n",
      "and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life--I resolved to capture him,\n",
      "spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in.  And thinking the\n",
      "hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to\n",
      "might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's crew for a pull on a\n",
      "whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate's\n",
      "boat--Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way, Captain--Mounttop;\n",
      "Mounttop--the captain);--as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop's\n",
      "boat, which, d'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and\n",
      "snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.\n",
      "But, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls alive, man--the next\n",
      "instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both eyes out--all befogged\n",
      "and bedeadened with black foam--the whale's tail looming straight up\n",
      "out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple.  No use\n",
      "sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding\n",
      "sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second\n",
      "iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima tower,\n",
      "cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes\n",
      "first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all\n",
      "chips.  We all struck out.  To escape his terrible flailings, I\n",
      "seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment\n",
      "clung to that like a sucking fish.  But a combing sea dashed me off,\n",
      "and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards,\n",
      "went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron\n",
      "towing along near me caught me here\" (clapping his hand just below\n",
      "his shoulder); \"yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to\n",
      "Hell's flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the\n",
      "good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh--clear along the\n",
      "whole length of my arm--came out nigh my wrist, and up I\n",

      "The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all\n",

      "sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and\n",
      "patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention\n",
      "between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in\n",
      "the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, then,\" interrupted Bunger, \"give him your left arm for bait to\n",

      "mathematically bowing to each Captain in succession--\"Do you know,\n",
      "gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably\n",
      "constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite impossible for him\n",
      "to completely digest even a man's arm?  And he knows it too.  So that\n",
      "what you take for the White Whale's malice is only his awkwardness.\n",
      "For he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to\n",
      "terrify by feints.  But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow,\n",
      "formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow\n",
      "jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest,\n",
      "and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an\n",
      "emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d'ye see.  No possible\n",
      "way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into\n",
      "his general bodily system.  Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick\n",
      "enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the\n",
      "privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that case\n",
      "the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you\n",
      "shortly, that's all.\"\n",

      "not to another one.  No more White Whales for me; I've lowered for\n",
      "him once, and that has satisfied me.  There would be great glory in\n",
      "killing him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm\n",

      "\n",
      "At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all\n",

      "consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and\n",
      "Spitzbergen whale fishery.  In the first place, the amount of butter,\n",
      "and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing.  I impute it,\n",

      "more unctuous by the nature of their vocation, and especially by\n",

      "this would seem somewhat improbable.  Yet they did aim at them, and\n",
      "hit them too.  But this was very far North, be it remembered, where\n",
      "beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the Equator, in our\n",

      "In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\n",
      "Feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\n",
      "been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\n",
      "fifth in length compared with the living body.  Of this seventy-two\n",
      "feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some\n",
      "fifty feet of plain back-bone.  Attached to this back-bone, for\n",

      "\n",

      "extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\n",
      "the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\n",
      "twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,\n",
      "for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ribs were ten on a side.  The first, to begin from the neck, was\n",
      "nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\n",
      "successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\n",
      "of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches.  From\n",
      "that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last\n",
      "only spanned five feet and some inches.  In general thickness, they\n",
      "all bore a seemly correspondence to their length.  The middle ribs\n",

      "largest of the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that\n",
      "part of the fish which, in life, is greatest in depth.  Now, the\n",
      "greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must\n",
      "have been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib\n",
      "measured but little more than eight feet.  So that this rib only\n",
      "conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that\n",
      "part.  Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked spine, all\n",
      "that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh,\n",
      "muscle, blood, and bowels.  Still more, for the ample fins, I here\n",
      "saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the weighty and\n",
      "majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\n",
      "\n",

      "his dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood.  No.\n",
      "Only in the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings\n",

      "There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are\n",
      "not locked together.  They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks\n",
      "on a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry.  The\n",
      "largest, a middle one, is in width something less than three feet,\n",
      "and in depth more than four.  The smallest, where the spine tapers\n",

      "Yea, more than equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and\n",
      "posterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy.\n",
      "For, not to hint of this: that it is an inference from certain\n",
      "canonic teachings, that while some natural enjoyments here shall have\n",
      "no children born to them for the other world, but, on the contrary,\n",
      "shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell's despair;\n",

      "lurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic\n",
      "significance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their\n",

      "strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of\n",

      "been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or\n",
      "uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal\n",
      "process.  He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had\n",

      "it was not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a\n",
      "dead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be\n",
      "floated away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they\n",
      "believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible\n",
      "horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue\n",
      "heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way.  He added,\n",
      "that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock,\n",
      "according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the\n",
      "death-devouring sharks.  No: he desired a canoe like those of\n",

      "\n",
      "Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the\n",
      "people on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every\n",

      "along with one of the paddles of his boat.  All by his own request,\n",
      "also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of\n",
      "fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth\n",
      "scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being\n",
      "rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his\n",
      "final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had.\n",
      "He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag\n",
      "and bring out his little god, Yojo.  Then crossing his arms on his\n",
      "breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he\n",
      "called it) to be placed over him.  The head part turned over with a\n",
      "leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but\n",
      "his composed countenance in view.  \"Rarmai\" (it will do; it is easy),\n",
      "he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.\n",
      "\n",
      "But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all\n",

      "During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream.\n",
      "Pip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now\n",
      "that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied;\n",
      "soon there seemed no need of the carpenter's box: and thereupon,\n",
      "when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said,\n",
      "that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;--at a critical\n",
      "moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was\n",
      "leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he\n",
      "could not die yet, he averred.  They asked him, then, whether to live\n",
      "or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure.  He\n",
      "answered, certainly.  In a word, it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a\n",
      "man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him:\n",
      "nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,\n",
      "unintelligent destroyer of that sort.\n",

      "Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and\n",
      "civilized; that while a sick, civilized man may be six months\n",
      "convalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well\n",
      "again in a day.  So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at\n",
      "length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but\n",
      "eating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet,\n",
      "threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned\n",
      "a little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat,\n",
      "and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight.\n",

      "\n",

      "to him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed\n",
      "forge shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed\n",
      "silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking\n",

      "tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no--no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper.\n",
      "Ahoy, there!  Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo!  What say ye, pagans!  Will\n",
      "ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb?\" holding it high\n",

      "Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of\n",
      "hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the\n",
      "socket of the iron.  A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and\n",
      "some fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great\n",

      "than an old wife's knitting needle.  But in either case, the needle\n",
      "never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or\n",

      "always hovering there.  For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever\n",

      "scanning them; no matter, though he stood so in the scuttle for a\n",
      "whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp gathered in\n",
      "beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat.  The clothes that\n",
      "the night had wet, the next day's sunshine dried upon him; and so,\n",
      "day after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath the\n",
      "planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.\n",
      "\n",
      "He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,--breakfast\n",
      "and dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which\n",
      "darkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over,\n",
      "which still grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper\n",
      "verdure.  But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck;\n",

      "own; yet these two never seemed to speak--one man to the\n",
      "other--unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made\n",
      "it necessary.  Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the\n",
      "twain; openly, and to the awe-struck crew, they seemed pole-like\n",
      "asunder.  If by day they chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb\n",

      "mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the\n",

      "And yet, somehow, did Ahab--in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,\n",

      "block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of\n",
      "the downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a\n",
      "pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail.  This done,\n",
      "with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked\n",
      "round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his\n",

      "and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate,\n",
      "said,--\"Take the rope, sir--I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.\"\n",

      "When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in\n",
      "the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea\n",
      "is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under\n",
      "these circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in\n",
      "strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it.\n",
      "Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various\n",

      "what is seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these\n",
      "ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings, it\n",
      "would be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a constant\n",
      "watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew\n",
      "be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.  So Ahab's\n",
      "proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing\n",
      "about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who\n",
      "had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree\n",
      "approaching to decision--one of those too, whose faithfulness on the\n",
      "look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was strange, that this\n",

      "incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these\n",
      "latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his\n",
      "head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings.  Then it darted a\n",
      "thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards,\n",
      "and went eddying again round his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed\n",
      "not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have\n",
      "marked it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost\n",

      "beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's\n",
      "head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel.  From this height the\n",
      "whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea\n",
      "revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent\n",
      "spout into the air.  To the credulous mariners it seemed the same\n",

      "stay on board, and keep the ship.  Helm there!  Luff, luff a point!\n",
      "So; steady, man, steady!  There go flukes!  No, no; only black water!\n",

      "breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his\n",
      "entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as\n",
      "if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of\n",
      "finest, fleecy, greenish foam.  He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of\n",
      "the slightly projecting head beyond.  Before it, far out on the soft\n",
      "Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his\n",
      "broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the\n",
      "shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into\n",
      "the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright\n",
      "bubbles arose and danced by his side.  But these were broken again by\n",
      "the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea,\n",
      "alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff\n",
      "rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered\n",
      "pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back; and at\n",
      "intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and\n",
      "fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked\n",
      "on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.\n",
      "\n",
      "A gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,\n",
      "invested the gliding whale.  Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away\n",
      "with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely,\n",
      "leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching\n",
      "fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not\n",
      "Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White\n",
      "Whale as he so divinely swam.\n",
      "\n",
      "On each soft side--coincident with the parted swell, that but once\n",
      "leaving him, then flowed so wide away--on each bright side, the whale\n",
      "shed off enticings.  No wonder there had been some among the hunters\n",
      "who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had\n",
      "ventured to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the\n",
      "vesture of tornadoes.  Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou\n",
      "glidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no matter how\n",
      "many in that same way thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed\n",
      "before.\n",

      "And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,\n",
      "among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture,\n",
      "Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of\n",
      "his submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his\n",
      "jaw.  But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for\n",
      "an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like\n",
      "Virginia's Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes\n",
      "in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of\n",
      "sight.  Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white\n",
      "sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.\n",
      "\n",
      "With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,\n",

      "reappearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An hour,\" said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he\n",
      "gazed beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide\n",
      "wooing vacancies to leeward.  It was only an instant; for again his\n",
      "eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle.\n",
      "The breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The birds!--the birds!\" cried Tashtego.\n",
      "\n",
      "In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were\n",
      "now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began\n",
      "fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with\n",
      "joyous, expectant cries.  Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab\n",
      "could discover no sign in the sea.  But suddenly as he peered down\n",
      "and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no\n",
      "bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and\n",
      "magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly\n",
      "revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating\n",
      "up from the undiscoverable bottom.  It was Moby Dick's open mouth and\n",
      "scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the\n",
      "blue of the sea.  The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like\n",
      "an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his\n",
      "steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous\n",
      "apparition.  Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him,\n",
      "went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his\n",
      "crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\n",
      "its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet\n",
      "under water.  But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with\n",
      "that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\n",
      "himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\n",
      "lengthwise beneath the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled\n",
      "for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner\n",
      "of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within\n",
      "his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high\n",
      "up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock.  The\n",
      "bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of\n",
      "Ahab's head, and reached higher than that.  In this attitude the\n",
      "White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her\n",
      "mouse.  With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms;\n",
      "but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to\n",
      "gain the uttermost stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as\n",
      "the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and\n",
      "from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be\n",
      "darted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as\n",
      "it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a\n",
      "quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac\n",
      "Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed\n",
      "him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with\n",
      "all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly\n",
      "strove to wrench it from its gripe.  As now he thus vainly strove,\n",
      "the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and\n",
      "snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft,\n",
      "bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again\n",
      "in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.  These floated\n",
      "aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging\n",
      "to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them\n",
      "across.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the\n",
      "first to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his\n",
      "head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment\n",
      "his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite.\n",
      "But only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over\n",
      "sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw;\n",
      "spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell\n",
      "flat-faced upon the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\n",
      "distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in\n",
      "the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled\n",
      "body; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or\n",
      "more feet out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their\n",
      "confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing\n",
      "their shivered spray still higher into the air.*  So, in a gale, the\n",
      "but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the\n",
      "Eddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale.  It receives its\n",
      "designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\n",
      "up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\n",
      "pitchpoling, previously described.  By this motion the whale must\n",
      "best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly\n",
      "round and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his\n",
      "vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more\n",
      "deadly assault.  The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden\n",
      "him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's\n",
      "elephants in the book of Maccabees.  Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in\n",
      "the foam of the whale's insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to\n",
      "swim,--though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a\n",
      "whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed\n",
      "bubble which the least chance shock might burst.  From the boat's\n",
      "fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the\n",
      "clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor him; more\n",
      "than enough was it for them to look to themselves.  For so\n",
      "revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so\n",
      "planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he\n",
      "seemed horizontally swooping upon them.  And though the other boats,\n",
      "unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the\n",
      "eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant\n",
      "destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that\n",
      "case could they themselves hope to escape.  With straining eyes,\n",
      "then, they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose\n",
      "centre had now become the old man's head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the\n",
      "ship's mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon\n",
      "the scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed\n",
      "her!--\"Sail on the\"--but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him\n",
      "from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time.  But struggling out of\n",
      "it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he\n",
      "shouted,--\"Sail on the whale!--Drive him off!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pequod's prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,\n",
      "she effectually parted the white whale from his victim.  As he\n",
      "sullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white\n",
      "brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab's bodily\n",
      "strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom: for\n",
      "a time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one\n",
      "trodden under foot of herds of elephants.  Far inland, nameless wails\n",
      "came from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the\n",
      "more abbreviate it.  In an instant's compass, great hearts sometimes\n",
      "condense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains\n",
      "kindly diffused through feebler men's whole lives.  And so, such\n",
      "hearts, though summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods\n",
      "decree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly\n",
      "made up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless\n",
      "centres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of\n",
      "inferior souls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The harpoon,\" said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on\n",
      "one bended arm--\"is it safe?\"\n",

      "off from me!  The eternal sap runs up in Ahab's bones again!  Set the\n",

      "\n",
      "It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being\n",
      "picked up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the\n",
      "chase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars.  It\n",
      "was thus now.  But the added power of the boat did not equal the\n",
      "added power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his\n",
      "every fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if\n",
      "now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an\n",
      "indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew\n",

      "vicissitude.  The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered\n",
      "the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase.\n",
      "Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to\n",
      "their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having been\n",

      "others, shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on\n",
      "the rocking yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready\n",

      "calm and indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic\n",
      "fountain in his head, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity;\n",
      "but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching.  Rising with\n",
      "his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus\n",
      "booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and piling up a\n",
      "mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of seven\n",
      "miles and more.  In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes\n",

      "\"There she breaches! there she breaches!\" was the cry, as in his\n",
      "immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to\n",
      "Heaven.  So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\n",
      "against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\n",
      "for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\n",
      "stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\n",
      "intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!\" cried Ahab, \"thy hour\n",
      "and thy harpoon are at hand!--Down! down all of ye, but one man at\n",
      "the fore.  The boats!--stand by!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\n",
      "shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and\n",
      "halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped\n",
      "from his perch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lower away,\" he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare\n",

      "As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the\n",
      "first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for\n",
      "the three crews.  Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he\n",
      "told them he would take the whale head-and-head,--that is, pull\n",
      "straight up to his forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a\n",
      "certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the\n",
      "whale's sidelong vision.  But ere that close limit was gained, and\n",
      "while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his\n",
      "eye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in\n",
      "an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a\n",
      "lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of\n",
      "the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on\n",
      "annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made.  But\n",
      "skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in\n",
      "the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by\n",
      "a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's unearthly slogan tore\n",
      "every other cry but his to shreds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed\n",
      "and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the\n",
      "three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of\n",
      "themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in\n",
      "him; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to\n",
      "rally for a more tremendous charge.  Seizing that opportunity, Ahab\n",
      "first paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking\n",
      "in upon it again--hoping that way to disencumber it of some\n",
      "snarls--when lo!--a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of\n",
      "sharks!\n",
      "\n",
      "Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose\n",
      "harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came\n",
      "flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat.\n",
      "Only one thing could be done.  Seizing the boat-knife, he critically\n",
      "reached within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel;\n",
      "dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and\n",
      "then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the\n",
      "intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again.\n",
      "That instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining\n",
      "tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the\n",
      "more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed\n",
      "them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and\n",
      "then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom,\n",
      "in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced\n",
      "round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of\n",
      "punch.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out\n",
      "after the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture,\n",
      "while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial,\n",
      "twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and\n",
      "Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while\n",
      "the old man's line--now parting--admitted of his pulling into the\n",
      "creamy pool to rescue whom he could;--in that wild simultaneousness\n",
      "of a thousand concreted perils,--Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed\n",
      "drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting\n",
      "perpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad\n",
      "forehead against its bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into\n",
      "the air; till it fell again--gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men\n",
      "struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction as\n",
      "he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a\n",
      "little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and\n",
      "with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his\n",
      "flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the\n",
      "least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly\n",
      "drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea.  But soon, as if\n",
      "satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated\n",
      "forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled\n",
      "lines, continued his leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\n",
      "came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\n",
      "floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,\n",
      "and safely landed them on her decks.  Some sprained shoulders,\n",
      "wrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;\n",
      "inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all\n",
      "these were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have\n",
      "befallen any one.  As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now\n",

      "comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous\n",
      "day's mishap.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him;\n",
      "as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the\n",
